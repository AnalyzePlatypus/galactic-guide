<p>The classic folk myth about a naive young adventurer who rose to become a powerful magic-user. First the adventurer recovered the scattered Twenty Treasures of Zork. Next, he conquered the mischievous mage, the Wizard of Frobozz. Finally, he defeated the reigning archmage, the Dungeon Master in the colloquial of the story, and took his position.</p>
<p>It has been translated into every known medium and is a profoundly moving today as it was to its original audience, now lost to us in the veils of time-space.</p>
<p>Of some note to both scholars and travellers:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">The M'rsst civilization (intelligent spores) reenact the myth cycle in pheremones once every mating season (roughly every 78.3 standard years). Book your reservations early and ask the M'rsst Tourism Council about group discounts.</li>
<li value="2">In some backwoods regions of the galaxy Zork remains primarily forgotten, the inhabitants preferring flashy multimedia nonsense to its simple, classic beauty.</li>
</ol>
<p>Highly recommended. <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
