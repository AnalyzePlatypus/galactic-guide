<p>Proving you are not insane is a difficult thing to do indeed. One way <em>not</em> to go about this task is to shout "No people, I am not insane!" Shouting that you are not insane will make people believe that you are, because only insane people shout that they are not insane. Continuing with "...or, no people, wait, I have made a mistake, I <em>am</em> insane!" won't help you much either.</p>
<p>The thing you will have to do before you try to prove that you are not insane, is find out if you <em>are</em>. Rest assured, as long as you can ask yourself this, and as long as you are bothered with other people having the wrong idea about you, there must still be some sanity in you.</p>
<p>But then again, <em>actually</em> questioning your sanity, and working out how to prove you are not insane, implicates that you <em>have</em> got a problem with your sanity (no matter what)!</p>
