    text: "The Eurostar, which connects France (Paris) to England (London Waterloo) via the Channel Tunnel, is also a TGV. You may have seen an incorrect version (blue instead of yellow etc.) of it in &quot;Mission Impossible&quot;, the movie with Tom Cruise. Or on the news, when a truck caught fire whilst being transported through the channel tunnel, November 1996. Repairs to the tunnel would prevent the train from running for several weeks."

<p>The Thalys is the red version of the Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV), the French high velocity train <a href="#footnote-body.1" name="footnote-link.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a> which typically cruises at about 300 kilometres an hour. Thalys doesn't reach this speed in the Netherlands and Belgium <a href="#footnote-body.2" name="footnote-link.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a>, where the railway tracks are still too bent and crooked to service this train correctly. Still, with respect to the old trains, almost an hour is gained in France, making the transit between Amsterdam and Paris last four hours and three quarters <a href="#footnote-body.3" name="footnote-link.3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a>. On the way it stops at:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Amsterdam</li>
<li value="2">Schiphol Airport</li>
<li value="3">The Hague (Den Haag, Hollands Spoor)</li>
<li value="4">Rotterdam</li>
<li value="5">Antwerp (Antwerpen, Berchem)</li>
<li value="6">Brussels</li>
<li value="7">Paris (Gare du Nord)</li>
</ol>
<p>A track linking Paris to Koln is being constructed.</p>
<p>Inside Thalys it is both more and less comfortable than expected. The seats are much like in airplanes: cramped and with a retractable table. For tall people there is hardly any space for the legs. The seats, however are comfortably soft. There is an (expensive) bar carriage where you can buy drinks and food using either Belgian, French or Dutch currency.</p>
<p>About TGVs: the high velocity itself is hardly noticeable. The ride is very smooth and there is hardly any noise <a href="#footnote-body.4" name="footnote-link.4" class="footnote-link">[4]</a>. Only by looking outside at objects passing by closely will you notice how fast you are going, and sometimes also pressure on your bottom alerts you to rapid ascents.</p>
<h2>Important Tips</h2>
<p>Four trains make this route per day <a href="#footnote-body.5" name="footnote-link.5" class="footnote-link">[5]</a>, and reservations for the special Thalys tickets <a href="#footnote-body.6" name="footnote-link.6" class="footnote-link">[6]</a> are obligatory. The whole one way trip will then cost you 132 guilders, but it is cheaper during weekends and for seniors and children. Also, taking the risk of no refund when you should need to cancel, you can book a return trip (2nd class, of course) for the same amount as a one way ticket!</p>
<p>If there are large delays or you are blessed with annoying personnel, you may be able to get some of your money back.</p>
