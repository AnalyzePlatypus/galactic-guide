<p>This question was posted to the Usenet Oracle:</p>
<pre>
     What is the best way to win the lottery?
</pre>
<pre>
     Please tell me so I can buy more computers to bombard you with
     questions.
</pre>
<p>And in response, thus spake the Oracle:</p>
<pre>
     The mathematical truth is, all combinations of numbers are equally
     likely.  Despite this, nobody ever plays 1-2-3-4-5-6.  Everyone says
     it's STUPID and will NEVER WIN!  So, although you only have the same
     chance as everyone else, if you play 1-2-3-4-5-6 and win, you won't
     have to split the pot!
</pre>
<pre>
     On a second note, never play Quick-Pick numbers.  Think about it:
</pre>
<ol>
<li value="1">People are lazy.</li>
<li value="2">People designed computers.</li>
<li value="3">Therefore, computers are lazy.</li>
<li value="4">Computers pick Quick Pick numbers.</li>
<li value="5">Lots of people come in and ask for Quick Pick.</li>
<li value="6">Think about it: If you were the computer, would you come up with a different number for each person?</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, all Quick-Pick numbers are generally the same, except in states where this practice is outlawed by law, in which case only MOST of the Quick-Pick numbers are identical.</p>
<pre>
     You owe the Oracle 30% of your winnings.
