<div>
<p>A 'throwing book' is a horrendously bad novel which one can use to overcome writer's block. When you start fearing that your stuff is no good, you just read a page or two from the throwing book, shout "My <strong>dog</strong> could write better &amp;%$@ than this!" and fling it and go back to work.</p>
<p>This technique can backfire. I did it, and now my dog has a successful career writing under the pseudonym "Piers Anthony." He has a six-bedroom doghouse that he paid for himself and he doesn't come when I call.</p>
