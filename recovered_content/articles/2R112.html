------------------- The Code of the Geeks v2.1 ---------------------------
----------------------     July 18, 1994    ------------------------------
</pre>
<p>So you think you are a geek, eh? The first step is to admit to yourself your geekiness. No matter what anyone says, geeks are people too; geeks have rights. So take a deep breath and announce to the world that you are a geek. Your courage will give you strength that will last you forever.</p>
<p>How to tell the world you are a geek, you ask? Use the universal Geek code. By joining the geek organization, you have license to use this special code that will allow you to let other un-closeted geeks know who you are in a simple, codified statement.</p>
<p>The single best way to announce your geekhood is to add your geek code to signature file and announce it far and wide. But be careful, you may give other geeks the courage to come out of the closet. You might want to hang on to your copy of the code in order to help them along.</p>
<p>Suggestions welcome.</p>
<p>Send them to:<br/>

BACKGROUND:
     The first version of the Geek Code was 0.1 and consisted of only
     about five categories.  0.2 was mostly a spelling and bug fix.
     0.3 added a couple more categories.
</pre>
<pre>
     1.0 was released about 4 months after 0.3 on July 17, 1993 and
     added several more categories as well as the rules for cross-overs
     and variables.  1.0.1 was a bug-fix released later that day.
</pre>
<pre>
     Over the course of the next year or so, I received some 75 or so
     various suggestions for improvements and changs in the Geek Code.
     Due to time, I wasn't able to sit down and collect and sort all of
     the suggestions and put everything together.  Finally, in early
     July, 1994, I found the time and decided that I would release
     version 2.0 on July 17, 1994, one year after version 1.0.  Version
     2.0 and represents the recommendations of many dozens of people
     too numerous to mention in here.
</pre>
<pre>
     This version, 2.1, represents the fixing of several serious bugs
     that slipped through while I was in a hurry to get 2.0 out the
     door.
</pre>
<pre>
     I hope you like the Geek Code and find it an entertaining and
     useful file.
</pre>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS:<br/>
The geek code consists of several categories. Each category is labeled with a letter and some qualifiers. Go through each category and determine which set of qualifiers best describes you in that category. By stringing all of these 'codes' together, you are able to construct your overall geek code. It is this single line of code that will inform other geeks the world over of what a great geek you actually are.</p>
<p>Some of the qualifiers will very probably not match with you exactly. Simply choose that qualifier that MOST CLOSELY matches you. Also, some activities described in a specific qualifier you may not engage in, while you do engage in others. Each description of each qualifier describes the wide range of activities that apply, so as long as you match with one, you can probably use that qualifier.</p>
<p>Also, pay particular attention to case-sensitivity, there can be a big difference between a 'u' and a 'U'.</p>
<p>----------------------</p>
<p>VARIABLES:<br/>
Geeks can seldom be quantified. To facilitate the fact that within any one category the geek may not be able determine a specific rating, variables have been designed to allow this range to be included.</p>
<pre>
     @    for variable, said trait is not very rigid, may change with
          time or with individual interaction.  For example, Geeks
          who happen to very much enjoy Star Trek:  The Next Generation,
          but dislike the old 60's series might list themselves as
          t++@.
     ()   for indicating "cross-overs" or ranges.  Geeks who go from
          C+ to C--- depending on the situation (i.e. mostly "c+") could
          use C+(---).  Another example might be an m++(**).  This
          would be a person who mostly listens to classical music, but
          also has an extensive collection of other types of works.
     &gt;    for 'wannabe' ratings.  Indicating that while the geek is
          currently at one rating, they are striving to reach another.
          For example, C-&gt;++
     $    Indicates that this particular category is done for a
          living.  For example, UL+++$ indicates that the person
          utilizes unix and gets paid for it.  Quite a lucky geek,
          for sure.
</pre>
<pre>
     @ is different from () in that () has finite limits within the
     category, while @ ranges all over.
</pre>
<p>-----------------------</p>
<p>TYPE:<br/>
Geeks come in many flavors. The flavors relate to the vocation of the particular geek. To start a code, a geek must declare himself or herself to be a geek. To do this, we start the code with a "G" to denote "GEEK", followed by one or two letters to denote the geeks occupation or field of study. Multi-talented geeks with more than one vocational training should denote their myriad of talents with a slash between each vocation (example: GCS/MU/T).</p>
<pre>
     GB     --  Geek of Business
     GC     --  Geek of Classics
     GCA    --  Geek of Commercial Arts
     GCM    --  Geek of Computer Management
     GCS    --  Geek of Computer Science
     GE     --  Geek of Engineering
     GED    --  Geek of Education
     GFA    --  Geek of Fine Arts
     GG     --  Geek of Government
     GH     --  Geek of Humanities
     GJ     --  Geek of Jurisprudence (Law)
     GL     --  Geek of Literature
     GM     --  Geek of Math
     GMD    --  Geek of Medicine
     GMU    --  Geek of Music
     GP     --  Geek of Philosophy
     GPM    --  Geek of Pre-Med
     GS     --  Geek of Science (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, etc.)
     GSS    --  Geek of Social Science (Psychology, Sociology, etc.)
     GT     --  Geek of Theater
     GTW    --  Geek of Technical Writing
</pre>
<pre>
     GO     --  Geek of Other.  Some types of geeks deviate from the
                normal geek activities.  This is encouraged as true geeks
                come from all walks of life.
     GU     --  Geek of 'Undecided'.  This is a popular vocation with
                incoming freshmen.
</pre>
<pre>
     GAT    --  Geek of All Trades.  For those geeks that can do
                anything and everything.  GAT usually precludes the use
                of other vocational descriptors.
</pre>
<pre>
     G!     --  Geek of No Qualifications

                                 APPEARANCE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>DRESS:<br/>
Geeks come in many different types of dress.</p>
<pre>
        d++     I tend to wear conservative dress such as a business
                suit.
        d+      I tend to wear trendy political messages like "Save the
                Whales" or "Free South Africa".
        d       I dress a lot like those found in catalog ads.  Bland,
                boring, without life or meaning.
        d-      I tend to wear trendy political messages like "Nuke the
                Humans", "Question Authority", or "Big Brother's Watching".
        d--     I wear jeans to work just to piss off my boss
        d---    At work, I have holes in my jeans and/or obscenities on
                my shirt.
        d----   Punk dresser
</pre>
<pre>
        dx      Cross Dresser
        d?      I have no idea what I am wearing right now, let alone
                what I wore yesterday.
        !d      No clothing.  Quite a fashion statement, don't you think?
        -d+     I wear the same clothes all the time, no matter the
                occasion, often forgetting to do laundry between wearings.
</pre>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>HAIR:<br/>
Just as geeks have a stylish dress appearance, a geek's hair can also be an important statement. Add an 'h' rating to tell about your hair.</p>
<pre>
        H+++    My hair goes down past my waist
        H++     My hair dangles to my mid-back
        H+      It's down to about my shoulders
        H       It's just pretty normal hair
        H-      It's cut above the neck
        H--     Above the neck AND ear (flattop)
        H---    It's about 1/8" long.
        H----   I shave my head daily, otherwise it gets too long
</pre>
<pre>
        !H      I'm bald
        H?      I have wigs that allow me to vary my hair
        H*      My hair is dyed funky flavors (add the '*' to one of the
                above)
</pre>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>SHAPE:<br/>
Geeks come in many shapes and sizes. Shape code is divided into two parts. The first indicates height, while the second indicates roundness. Mix each section to fit yourself. Examples include: s:++, s++:, s++:--.</p>
<pre>
        s+++:+++   I usually have to duck through doors/I take up
                   three movie seats.
        s++:++     I'm a basketball/linebacker candidate.
        s+:+       I'm a little taller/rounder than most.
        s          I'm an average geek
        s-:-       I look up to most people.  Everyone tells me to gain
                   a few pounds.
        s--:--     I look up to damn near everybody.  I tend to have
                   to fight against a strong breeze.
        s---:---   I take a phone book with me when I go out so I can
                   see to eat dinner.  My bones are poking through my
                   skin.
</pre>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>GLASSES:<br/>
Geeks have traditionally worn glasses.</p>
<pre>
        g+++    I have coke-bottle classes that I can use to start leaves
                on fire in the hot sun.
        g++     I've got four eyes and tape in the middle.
        g+      I've got four eyes, what's your point?
        g-      I have contacts
        g--     I have colored contacts
        g---    I have those funky contact that have interesting designs on
                them such as happy faces or some such.
</pre>
<pre>
        !g      I have no glasses.
        g?      I can't find my glasses.
</pre>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>PENS:<br/>
Geeks have lots of pens (and pen-like things) in their shirt pockets. Look down at your shirt pocket and count them. Add a p(number) into your code, where p stands for pen-count.</p>
<pre>
        p#      Average number of pens or pencils in a geek's pocket at
                any given moment in time.
        p?      I can't find a writing instrument
        !p      pens are obsolete.  I have a newton.
</pre>
<p>If there is also a calculator (or slide rule) often attached to your belt or in your pocket or you carry a portable computer around with you, add a plus sign, i.e. p4+.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>AUTOMOBILE:<br/>
There is an old saying that one's wheels define a person. Tell the world about yours.</p>
<pre>
        au++++  I have my chauffeured limo take me everywhere.
        au+++   I own four different colored Mercedes.
        au++    I drive a brand new car that cost more than most houses
        au+     I have a sporty-looking car which would be a babe-mobile
                if I wasn't such a geek.
        au      I drive a car which I bought from my parents.  It has four
                doors even though I'm the only one who ever rides in it.
        au-     I drive my parents' car.  Hey, if I could afford my own I
                wouldn't be living at home with them (see section on
                housing).
        au--    My car has rust everywhere and the muffler drags along
                the ground.
        au---   I drive a '77 Pinto which went over 100,000 miles two
                years ago.
        au----  I have a Yugo
</pre>
<pre>
        !au     I don't have a car
        au*     I have a motorcycle
</pre>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>AGE:<br/>
The only way to become a true geek is through practice and experience. To this end, your age becomes an important part of your geekiness. Use the qualifiers below to show your age (in Terran years).</p>
<pre>
        a+++    60 and up
        a++     50-59
        a+      40-49
        a       30-39
        a-      20-29
        a--     10-19
        a---    9 and under
        a?      ageless
        !a      it's none of your business how old I am
</pre>
<p>In addition, if you wish to give your exact age, you can place the number after the 'a' identifier. For example: a42</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>WEIRDNESS:<br/>
Geeks have a seemingly natural knack for being "weird". Of course, this is a subjective term as one person's weirdness is another person's normalness. As a general rule, the following weird qualifiers allow a geek to rate their weirdness.</p>
<pre>
        w+++    Mainstream?  I heard of that once, I think.
        w++     I am so weird, I make Al Yankovic look sane.
        w+      so?  what's your problem with weird.
        w       I am not weird.  I'm perfectly normal.
        w-      I'm more normal that most people normally are.
        w--     I am so incredibly boring...
</pre>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>VERBAGE:<br/>
A geeks mastery of the spoken language is an important attribute. Tell us about it.</p>
<pre>
        v---    I don't talk.  I just type.
        v--     When I talk, people usually look mildly embarrassed.
        v-      I use words like 'grok' in everyday conversation.
        v       At least I speak in complete sentences.  Usually.
        v+      People compliment me on my vocabulary.
        v++     People compliment me on my eloquence.
        v+++    I was the regional forensics champ.
</pre>
<pre>
        !v      Speech is irrelevant, I use telepathy
        v?      I mumble
        v*      I babble
</pre>
<pre>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              S E C T I O N  II
                                  COMPUTERS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>COMPUTERS:<br/>
Most geeks identify themselves by their use of computers and computer networks. In order to quantify your geekiness level on computers, consult the following (consider the term 'computers' synonymous with 'computer network'):</p>
<pre>
        C++++   I'll be first in line to get the new cybernetic interface
                installed into my skull.
        C+++    You mean there is life outside of Internet?  You're shittin'
                me!  I live for muds.  I haven't dragged myself to class in
                weeks.
        C++     Computers are a large part of my existence.  When I get up
                in the morning, the first thing I do is log myself in.  I
                mud on weekends, but still manage to stay off of academic
                probation.
        C+      Computers are fun and I enjoy using them.  I play a mean
                game of DOOM! and can use a word processor without resorting
                to the manual too often.  I know that a 3.5" disk is not a
                hard disk.  I also know that when it says 'press any key to
                continue', I don't have to look for a key labeled 'ANY'.
        C       Computers are a tool, nothing more.  I use it when it serves
                my purpose.
        C-      Anything more complicated than my calculator and I'm
                screwed.
        C--     Where's the on switch?
        C---    If you even mention computers, I will rip your head off!
</pre>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>UNIX:<br/>
It seems that a Unix-based operating system is the OS of choice among most geeks. In addition to telling us about your unix abilities, you can also show which specific unix OS you are using. To accomplish this, you include a letter showing the brand with your rating. For example: UL++++ would indicate a sysadmin running Linux.</p>
<pre>
        B       BSD (use this unless your BSDish system is mentioned below)
        L       Linux
        U       Ultrix
        A       AIX
        V       SysV
        H       HPUX
        I       IRIX
        O       OSF/1
        S       Sun OS/Solaris
        C       SCO Unix
        X       NeXT
        ?       Some other one not listed
</pre>
<pre>
        U++++   I am the sysadmin. If you try and crack my machine don't be
                surprised if the municipal works department gets an
                "accidental" computer-generated order to put start a new
                landfill on your front lawn.
        U+++    I don't need to crack /etc/passwd because I just modified
                su so that it doesn't prompt me.  The admin staff doesn't
                even know I'm here.  If you don't understand what I just
                said, this category does NOT apply to you!
        U++     I've get the entire admin ticked off at me because I am
                always using all of the CPU time and trying to run programs
                that I don't have access to.  I'm going to try cracking
                /etc/passwd next week, just don't tell anyone.
        U+      I not only have a unix account, but I slam VMS any chance I
                get.
        U       I have a unix account to do my stuff in
        U-      I have a VMS account.
        U--     I've seen unix and didn't like it.  DEC rules!
        U---    Unix geeks are actually nerds in disguise.
</pre>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>PERL:<br/>
If you enjoy at least U++ status you have to know about Perl, so you might as well rate yourself in this sub-category. Non-unix geeks don't know what they're missing.</p>
<pre>
        P++++   I don't write Perl, I speak it.  Perl has superseded all
                other programming languages.  I firmly believe that all
                programs can be reduced to a Perl one-liner.  I use Perl to
                achieve U+++ status.
        P+++    Perl is a very powerful programming tool. Not only do I no
                longer write shell scripts,  I also no longer use awk or
                sed.  I use Perl for all programs of less than a thousand
                lines.
        P++     Perl is a powerful programming tool.  I don't write shell
                scripts anymore because I write them in Perl.
        P+      I know of perl.  I like perl.  I just haven't learned much
                perl, but it is on my agenda.
        P-      What's Perl got that awk and sed don't have?
        P--     Perl users are sick, twisted programmers who are just showing
                off.
        P---    Perl combines the power of sh, the clarity of sed, and the
                performance of awk with the simplicity of C.  It should be
                banned.
</pre>
<pre>
        P?      What's Pearl?
        !P      Our paranoid admin won't let us install perl!  Says it's a
                "hacking tool".
</pre>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>LINUX:<br/>
Linux is a hacker-written operating system virtually identical to unix. It originally and continues to run on your standard 386/486/Pentium PC, but is also being ported to other systems. Because it is still a young OS, and because it is continually evolving from hacker changes and support, it is important that the geek list his Linux ability.</p>
<pre>
        L++++   I am Linus, hear me roar.
        L+++    I am a Linux wizard.  I munch C code for breakfast and have
                enough room left over for a kernel debugging.  I have so
                many patches installed that I lost track about ten versions
                ago.  Linux newbies consider me a net.god.
        L++     I use Linux almost exclusively on my system.  I monitor
                comp.os.linux.* and even answer questions some times.  I've
                aliased Linux FTP sites to make getting new software easier.
        L+      I've managed to get Linux installed and even used it a few
                times.  It seems like it is just another OS.
        L       I know what Linux is, but that's about all
        L-      I have no desire to use Linux and frankly don't give a rats
                patootie about it.
        L--     Unix sucks.  Because Linux = Unix.  Linux Sucks.  I worship
                Bill Gates.
        L---    I am Bill Gates.
</pre>
<pre>
        !L      I don't even know what Linux is!
</pre>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>386BSD:<br/>
386bsd is another version of Unix written for 80x86 like systems. Often there is a friendly (and periodically not-so-friendly) rivalry between the forces of Linux and the forces of 386bsd. Identify your BSDish rating below.</p>
<pre>
        3+++    I am a 386bsd wizard.  I munch C code for breakfast and have
                enough room left over for a kernel debugging.  I have so
                many patches installed that I lost track about ten versions
                ago.  386bsd newbies consider me a net.god.
        3++     I use 386bsd almost exclusively on my system.  I monitor
                comp.os.386bsd.* and even answer questions some times.  I've
                aliased BSD FTP sites to make getting new software easier.

        M-      Macs suck.  All real geeks have a character prompt.

                allowing them to use the system without knowing what

<p>CYPHERPUNKS:<br/>
With the birth of the overused buzzword "The Information Superhighway", concerns over privacy from evil governmental bad-guys{tm} has led to the formation of of an unofficial, loosely organized band of civil libertarians who spend much of their time discussing how to insure privacy in the information future. This group is known by some as "cypherpunks" (to others, as anarchistic subversives). To this end, tell us how punkish you are.</p>

        Y-      It seems to me that all of these concerns are a little
                extreme.  I mean, the government must be able to protect
                itself from criminals.
        Y--     Get a life.  The only people that need this kind of

<p>STAR TREK:<br/>
Most geeks have an undeniable love for the Star Trek television show (in any of its four forms). Because GEEK is often synonymous with TREKKIE (real geeks aren't so anal as to label themselves TREKKER), it is important that all geeks list their Trek rating.</p>
<pre>
        t+++    It's not just a TV show, its a religion.  I know all about
                warp field dynamics and the principles behind the
                transporter.  I have memorized the TECH manual.  I speak
                Klingon.  I go to cons with Vulcan ears on.  I have no life.
        t++     It's the best show around.  I have all the episodes and the
                movies on tape and can quote entire scenes verbatim.  I've
                built a few of the model kits too.  But you'll never
                catch me at one of those conventions.  Those people are
                kooks.
        t+      It's a damn fine TV show and is one of the only things
                good on television any more.
        t       It's just another TV show
        t-      Maybe it is just me, but I have no idea what the big deal
                with Star Trek is.  Perhaps I'm missing something but I just
                think it is bad drama.
        t--     Star Trek is just another Space Opera.  William Shatner
                isn't an actor, he's a poser!  And what's with this Jean-Luc
                Picard?  A Frenchman with a British accent?  Come on.  I'd
                only watch this show if my remote control broke.

<p>BABYLON 5:<br/>
For many years, Sci-Fi geeks have wished for a television show that would overcome the limitations of Star Trek. For many, a new show called Babylon 5 has met that demand, with a deep storyline, exciting characters and state-of-the-art computer generated effects.</p>
<pre>
        5+++    I am a True Worshipper of the Church of Joe who lives
                eats breathes and thinks Babylon 5, and has Evil toughts
                about stealing Joe's videotape archives just to see
                episodes earlier.  I am planning to break into the bank
                and steal the triple-encoded synopsis of the 5-year arc.
        5++     Finally a show that shows what a real future would look
                like.  None of this Picardian "Let's talk about it and be
                friends" crap.  And what's this?  We finally get to see a
                bathroom!  Over on that Enterprise, they've been holding
                it for over seven years!
        5+      Babylon 5 certainly presents a fresh perspective in the
                Sci-Fi universe.  I watch it weekly.
        5       I've seen it, I am pretty indifferent to it.
        5-      This show is sub-par.  The acting is wooden, the special
                effects are obviously poor quality.  In general, it seems
                like a very cheap Star Trek ripoff.
        5--     You call this Sci-Fi?  That is such a load of crap!  This
                show is just a soap with bad actors, piss-poor effects,
                and lame storylines.  Puh-leese.

                know better than I know myself.
        R       Role-Playing?  That's just something to do to kill a

<p>MAGIC: The Gathering:<br/>
Magic: The Gathering is taking over. If you haven't heard of it, it involves collecting cards that summon creatures, cast spells, represent artifacts, etc., for the purpose of reducing the opponent's life points from 20 to 0 in the course of a game. Many of geeks have spent over $100 on these things, some a lot more.</p>

        B+++    I worship the ground He walks on.  I wish to erect a
                shrine for Him in my front yard.  I feel a need to sell
                all my worldly belongings, shave my head, and go to
                airports where I will hand out Barney dolls and spread
                His message of universal love for everyone regardless of
                race, creed, color, sexual preference, or species.
        B++     I don't miss an episode, except when I have to work or
                go in for a root canal.  Barney loves me.
        B+      I like him.  He has a nice, wholesome message.  He's
                good for the country.
        B       Hey, the little tykes love him, they don't go around
                karate-chopping each other any more; what's the big deal?
        B-      Barney is annoying
        B--     Don't talk to me about him.  I'm getting sick of his
                smarmy message.  He makes me ill.
        B---    He's sick.  He's polluting our children's minds with
                this love and tolerance crap.  Boycott any station or
                store that carries him.  His head would really look good
                on my wall next to stuffed Smurfs.

        B?      Who's Barney?

                                 LIFESTYLE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>EDUCATION:<br/>
All geeks have a varying amount of education.</p>
<pre>
        e++++   Still pretty stupid, over qualified to work any job, went and
                got my Ph.D.
        e+++    Had not learned enough to know better not to go back and try
                for a master's degree.
        e++     Managed to finish my bachelors.
        e+      Started a degree, plan to finish it some day.
        e       K-12, been on a college campus.
        e-      Got my bachelors, escaped alive, and am making hoards of
                money writing unmaintainable (except by me) software.
        e--     The company I work for was dumb enough to fund my way through
                a masters degree, then started paying me even more money.
        e---    Achieved a Ph.D, have devoted my life to insignificant
                research, which my employer pays dearly for.
</pre>
<pre>
        !e      Flunked high school, learned life the hard way
        e*      I learned everything there is to know about life from the
                "Hitchhiker's Trilogy".
</pre>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>MUSIC:<br/>
Musical interests vary widely, also.</p>
<pre>
        u+++    I consider myself over-refined and grok that heavy-duty
                elevator music.
        u++     I consider myself refined and enjoy classical and new-age
                selections
        u+      I own a tape or CD collection (records also count, but you
                would be admitting how old you really are).
        u       I occasionally listen to the radio
        u-      Just play it loud
        u--     I play air-guitar better than anyone else.
        u---    LISTEN!  I SAID TO PLAY IT LOUD!
</pre>
<pre>
        u*      I listen to music that no one else has ever heard of
        u**     I listen to so many types of music that I can't even
                keep them straight
</pre>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>-u I like <em>both</em> kinds of music</dt>
<dd>Country AND Western</dd>
</dl>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>HOUSING:<br/>
Tell us about your geeky home.</p>
<pre>
        h++     Living in a cave with 47 computers and an Internet feed,
                located near a Dominoes pizza.  See !d.
        h+      Living alone, get out once a week to buy food, no more than
                once a month to do laundry.  All surfaces covered.
        h       Friends come over to visit every once in a while to talk
                about Geek things.  There is a place for them to sit.
        h-      Living with one or more registered Geeks.
        h--     Living with one or more people who know nothing about
                being a Geek and refuse to watch 'Star Trek'.
        h---    Married, with the potential for children. (persons living
                with a fiance might as well label themselves h---, you're as
                good as there already.)
        h----   Married with children - Al Bundy can sympathize
</pre>
<pre>
        h!      I am stuck living with my parents!
        h*      I'm not sure where I live anymore.  This lab/workplace seems
                like home to me.
</pre>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>FRIENDS:<br/>
Yes, it's true; geeks do have friends. At least, some of them do.</p>
<pre>
        f++     I have so many friends, I make other people jealous.
        f+      I have quite a few really close friends.  We get along great.
                They are all other geeks, though.
        f       Yeah, I have friends.  Who told you?
        f-      I have a few friends.  They barely seem to speak to me
                anymore.
        f--     I've got about one friend left in the world, who probably
                wants to shoot me.
        f---    I used to have friends, but I didn't like it
</pre>
<pre>
        f?      I *think* I have friends.
        f*      Everyone is my friend.
        !f      I have no friends.  Get lost.
</pre>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>RELATIONSHIPS:<br/>
Many geeks are highly successful at having relationships, a good many more are not. Give us the gritty details.</p>
<pre>
        r+++    Found someone, dated, and am now married.
        r++     I've dated my current SO for a long time
        r+      I bounce from one relationship to another, but I have
                quite a few.
        r       I date periodically
        r-      I have difficulty maintaining a relationship
        r--     Most people aren't interested in dating me
        r---    I'm beginning to think I'm a leper or something, the way
                people avoid me like the plague
</pre>
<pre>
        !r      I've never had a relationship
        r*      signifying membership in the SBCA (Sour Bachelor(ette)'s
                Club of America).  The motto is 'Bitter, but not Desperate'.
                First founded at Caltech.
</pre>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>NUTRITION:<br/>
Geeks usually consume food. Some eat everything they can grab while some others are quite conscious of their food. (Note: 'n' is used for nutrition as 'f' is used elsewhere.)</p>
<pre>
        n+++    I graze like a bunny - pass me a carrot!
        n++     I like the fibers in food
        n+      I like food - especially when it is healthy.
        n-      Food? I just grab something from the shelves with meat in it.
        n--     I eat only the cheap things - even with artificial meat and
                vegetables.
        n---    I eat meat - seen Jurassic Park?
        n----   I _live_ on snacks and coke.
</pre>
<pre>
        !n      Eh what? never mind the menu, give me something to eat!
</pre>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>SEX:<br/>
Geeks have traditionally had problems with sex (i.e., they never have any). Because geeks are so wrapped up in their sexuality (or lack of sexuality for that matter), it is important that the geek be willing to quantify their sexual experiences.</p>
<pre>
This code also is used to denote the gender of the geek.  Females use 'x' in
this category, while males use 'y'.  Those that do not wish to disclose
their gender can use 'z'.  For example:
        x+      A female who has had sex
        y+      A male who has had sex.
        z+      A person (gender undisclosed) who has had sex.
</pre>
<p>For those person who do not wish to give out any details of their sex life, the use of x? (where x is the gender code) will allow you to so.</p>
<pre>
        x++++   I have a few little rug rats to prove I've been there.
                Besides, with kids around, who has time for sex?
        x+++    I'm married, so I can get it (theoretically) whenever I
                want.
        x++     I was once referred to as 'easy'.  I have no idea where that
                might have come from though.
        x+      I've had real, live sex.
        x-      I prefer computer sex to real sex.
        x--     I was once referred to as a 'cyberslut', but I have no idea
                where that might have come from.
</pre>
<pre>
        x*      I'm a pervert.
        x**     I've been known to make perverts look like angels.
</pre>
<pre>
        !x      Sex?  What's that?  I've had no sexual experiences.
        x?      It's none of your business what my sex life is like (this
                is used to denote your gender only).
        !x+     Sex? What's that? No experience, willing to learn!
