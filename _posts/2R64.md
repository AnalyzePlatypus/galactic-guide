<p>This new town is at Junction 9 up the M1 motorway. It is south of Luton and north of Watford. As is common in English new towns, Hemel Hempstead is inflicted by a plague of roundabouts. The most famous of these is the "Magic Roundabout" of Hemel, second only to the legendary town of Milton Keynes into whose road system many brave travellers have ventured, never to return. The Magic Roundabout is made up from six little roundabouts arranged in a hexagon, with short roads linking them. Five major roads lead to and from the Magic Roundabout. (The sixth was unaccountably closed off). This cunning device does seem to keep traffic moving but it is a bit stressful trying to get onto and off of it, both undamaged and at the right exit.</p>
<p>There are no recommended Pubs or nightspots in Hemel and the cinema is a Bingo hall four times a week instead of a cinema. I have yet to meet someone who likes living there.</p>
<p>Hemel Hempstead has two large industrial parks which house sites for various companies including 3Com, UniPlex, Dell, and BICC, my current employer.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: My employers do not share my views and I don't speak for them.</p>
