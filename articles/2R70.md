<p>The Britannia Adelphi in Liverpool is a very high-ceilinged hotel, with lots of interesting chandeliers. At Sou'Wester (1994 British National Science Fiction Convention, or Eastercon), fandom put this space to good use.</p>
<p>One of the future conventions being advertised was Inconceivable, (Inconsequential II). This is a convention based on humour in science fiction, and run by mostly ZZ9 and Octarine <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a> members. They brought along a helium gas cylinder and balloons printed with their logo. At first the balloons were tied to the desk to make it more conspicuous but later on in the con flyers <a href="#footnotes.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a> were tied to them. By cutting off a certain amount of string, the flyers could be made to hover about the convention at eye level. They would rise and fall depending on air currents and temperature. Next a T-shirt was filled with balloons and tied to another bunch. This was a much more impressive demonstration of fannish aeronautics.</p>
<p>After the T-shirt escapade the team decided this was not enough. Fans often have a soft spot for fluffy stuffed animals <a href="#footnotes.3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a>. They can even buy convention memberships for their toys in order to receive the progress reports for them. A small toy hedgehog was soon to be seen floating around the room to the cries of "It's behind you!"</p>
<p>The Adelphi has a policy of keeping anything it finds in its chandeliers and so an attempt was made to retrieve lost balloons with another balloon tied to a long piece of string and covered with sticky tape.</p>
