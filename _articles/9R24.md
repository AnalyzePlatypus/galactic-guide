<p>Most people who eat ice cream in the presence of other people are unaware that they play a crucial part in a chain of events that will continue ice cream sales well into the future. Let me explain.</p>
<p>The sight of someone licking an ice cream is the best possible advertisement for the product; it will rather sooner than later cause a craving for ice cream with someone else. Satisfaction of that desire will in its turn cause a craving in another person, etcetera etcetera.</p>
<p>Think about it. All occasions of wanting an ice cream are preceded by a mental image of ice cream consumption in the past. This chain of events that I will call the "ice cream cascade", probably goes way back, right to the invention of the first ice cream.</p>
<p>The ice cream cascade is very likely the prime mechanism behind ice cream consumption <a href="#footnote-body.1" name="footnote-link.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>. Next time you lick an ice cream, think about all the famous people that have preceded your chain, probably including people such as Adolf Hitler, Hermann Goering, Joseph Goebbels, Benito Mussolini, Stalin, Idi Amin, Saddam Hussein, etc. etc. <a href="#footnote-body.2" name="footnote-link.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a><a href="#footnote-body.3" name="footnote-link.3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a><a href="#footnote-body.4" name="footnote-link.4" class="footnote-link">[4]</a></p>
