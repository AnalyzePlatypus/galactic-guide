<p>Filks are science fiction folk songs. Popular myth is that someone mistyped "folk" at a convention and the word "filk" stood.</p>
<p>A prime example of a filk is the one included below. This song was posted on alt.music.filk (or on the FidoNet echo moderated by Kay Shapero). I believe that Ellen would approve of this re-publication of her song.</p>

        "I Fought the Borg"
        ===================
</pre>
<pre>
        (sung to the tune of "I Fought the Law")
        by Ellen Edgerton

<pre>
        Met a cube-shaped ship near Deneb 1,
        I fought the Borg and the Borg won,
        I fought the Borg and the Borg won.
</pre>
<pre>
        Had my phaser set on maximum stun,
        I fought the Borg and the Borg won,
        I fought the Borg and the Borg won.
</pre>
<pre>
        Fired all my photons in surprise attack,
        I thought that they were done --
        But they regenerated and kept coming back,
        I fought the Borg and the Borg won,
        I fought the Borg and the Borg won.
</pre>
<pre>
        Went to Warp 9.9 and tried to run,
        I fought the Borg and the Borg won,
        I fought the Borg and the Borg won.
</pre>
<pre>
        Tried to get more power but I had none,
        I fought the Borg and the Borg won,
        I fought the Borg and the Borg won.
</pre>
<pre>
        Tried a suicide dive to scare them away,
        Right into a sun,
        But the bastards got me with a tractor ray,
        I fought the Borg and the Borg won,
        I fought the Borg and the Borg won.
</pre>
<pre>
        Now I'm Locutis and it ain't no fun,
        I fought the Borg and the Borg won,
        I fought the Borg and the Borg won.
