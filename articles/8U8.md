<p>If you intend to move your family to a foreign country be aware of the medical risks. A recent case involved the McLintock family who moved from south London to Chicago for two years. James and Lucy McLintock were normal British kids. They played football and spoke English. But on returning to Britain they had swollen alarmingly! (I am informed that this process is called growing). They now play "soccer" and have appalling American accents and slang. For instance I have been told that the American for "builder's behind" is "workman's crack".</p>
