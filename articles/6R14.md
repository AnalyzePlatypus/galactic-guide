<p>Useful Items of Hitchhiker Apparel: The Towel.</p>
<p>My towel probably deserves a little more comment. This was my first real travelling towel. We had been to Europe together, we had been in the army together, and we had become inseparable <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>. It was really starting to build up some character, with some lovely stains, each of which bought back memories of a different party or road-trip. It was a simple towel, six foot of plain, light blue (and rather blotchy by this time) towelling, with a fringe of white (well, a dirty grey) at each end.</p>
<p>This towel set off on its own adventures on Friday, 13th February 1987, when it hitched a lift after a party, and was never seen again. Luckily enough, I found a small blue piece of fluff under my fingernail, and my Personal Towel Technician (mother) was able to clone me a new towel from this. This towel is now in even worse condition that its parent towel. It is only towel condoms <a href="#footnotes.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a> that are stopping it from reproducing <a href="#footnotes.3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a>.</p>
