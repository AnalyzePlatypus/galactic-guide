<p>Mercury is the ultimate place in our solar system to get a nice tan. Some 88 sunny days a year is the everlasting weather forecast. Remember to bring along your sunblock factor 25,000 or you will involuntarily experience that all man are equal on Mercury. That is in fact the second attraction of the planet. No racism at all, for all non-sunblock-users turn into a crispy black.</p>
<p>Mercury is also the secret hiding place of Farookh Bulsara, former lead singer of the famous rock band "Queen." In contrary to the widespread belief he has died of AIDS, he has really been abducted by aliens.</p>
<p>The favorite pastime of people on Mercury is to, after a long day (58.6 Earth days) of lying on the beach (covering almost the whole planet), have a barbecue and maybe later on, skate on the crater-wide ice rinks at the poles.</p>
<p>A pity though that there are no bars, no cafe's, or whatever on Mercury to get the so much needed refreshment. No glasses to put ice cubes in either.</p>
<p>This leaves Mercury the perfect place to end your life, because without drinks you'll very soon start drinking your sunblock, and faster than you can say "chocolate covered doughnut" you'll turn into one.</p>
