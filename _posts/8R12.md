<p>How many times have you been rolling down the road with the motor humming a tune, minding your own business, dragging your pegs through a corner when suddenly - A WHOLE FAMILY OF DEER IS ABOUT TO LEAP INTO THE ROAD! I usually leave a skid mark on the pavement and maybe one on my seat before I realize they're plastic yard-enhancements. What specific genetic defect causes people to do this? Or do they all own towing companies? I can just imagine ma and pa setting on the porch swing chuckling as they hear those tires squeal in panic.</p>
<p>Anyway, on my vacation of last week I came across the most horrifying yard ornament yet. On a goat-track undivided road 656 in the hills of West- Central Ohio, as I round a blind uphill left-hander which drops quickly away to the right, a full size giraffe suddenly appears on the left not 10 feet away as I come over the crest way too fast. Once the adrenaline rush faded it was pretty funny. Giraffes in Ohio. Well, it certainly was an interesting vacation.</p>
