<p>Oestersund <a href="#footnote-body.1" name="footnote-link.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a> is a town located roughly in the middle of Sweden. It is neither famous for its picturesque buildings nor its slogan <a href="#footnote-body.2" name="footnote-link.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a>, nor for its location, nor name. The thing that it could be famous for is its attempt to be the place that has to pay billions for housing thousands of athletes during a few weeks, just to let them show off <a href="#footnote-body.3" name="footnote-link.3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a>. It's probably a good thing the town has always come second place in the election for the Olympics.</p>
<p>One thing that makes the town interesting for field researchers is the high pub-to-inhabitant ratio, so, if you're old enough, you'll always have a place to get a beer.</p>
<p>Things of interest for the casual tourist include Sweden's most northerly rune stone, Froesoestenen <a href="#footnote-body.4" name="footnote-link.4" class="footnote-link">[4]</a>, the lake monster that lives in the lake Storsjoen <a href="#footnote-body.5" name="footnote-link.5" class="footnote-link">[5]</a>, and the world's first outdoors museum, Jamtli.</p>
<p>The town is sometimes called "Sweden's Chicago" by the inhabitants since it's so windy. Another thing it could be called is San Francisco, since it's got so many steep streets that lead down to the lake.</p>
<p>Oestersund is also the home town, more-or-less, of the field researcher Olle Johansson.</p>
