footnotes: {"[1]":"A way to quantify luck is to count how many times major nice things have happened to you out of the blue. As an example I will mention some of those occasions I experienced myself:\n\nWhen I was a wee lad I was walking down the street with a friend, when somebody suddenly came up to us and offered us a holiday job.\nBeing a healthy young boy, the medical test revealed no shortcomings that would have made me unfit for military service. After that I sat back (basically) and lo and behold, after seven years of waiting I suddenly had a minor sports injury, sufficient to put me off the hook, but not enough to cause me any discomfort.\nThe only subject for my student research I could effectively choose was in a field of research that suddenly knew a tremendous breakthrough, which created a tailor made research program for me after graduation.\nI think this is about enough, I don't want to cause any envy!\n\n","[2]":"Some would reply here: \"you are a sucker for punishment!\"","[3]":"Did you notice this article said nothing about nothing?"}

<p>"Luck" is a vague and hard to measure quantity <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>. While some (eg. scientists) might argue that there are no such things as non-random probability fluctuations linked to individuals, the majority of people have an intuitive understanding of the existence of luck. This understanding often includes the aspect that "luck can change". This aspect is often encountered when in unhappy circumstances people try to comfort you by saying that your luck is bound to change.</p>
<p>Alas, that is not so. Luck is a conserved quantity. This should not cast you into desperation, because there is more. While it is true that not all have the same lifetime averaged amount of luck, everyone is sure to at least have some. The luck you have had up to now could have led you to consider yourself an unlucky person, but nothing has yet been said about the <em>spread</em> of luck around the average. Some may have little portions of luck every day, for instance a larger than average count of green traffic lights. Some may grow old without encountering their portion of luck, and then suddenly they win the jackpot (and die of a heart attack). It is just not possible to predict.</p>
<p>Sooner or later you <em>will</em> encounter an event of luck... like I have recently. I was just minding my business when I received an e-mail: "Hi, I just read your amazingly witty articles, and I have decided to marry you." Now how about that! <a href="#footnotes.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a></p>
<p>So next time you see a poor beggar, wrapped in a large blanket against the cold, don't say "now that's an unlucky bloke" but think again and say instead "now there's a guy with a wide spread!" <a href="#footnotes.3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a></p>
