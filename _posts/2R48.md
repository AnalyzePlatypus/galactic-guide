<p>Boredom is not, contrary to popular belief, a result of having nothing to do. It's very hard to come up with a situation where a person's options are so limited that he or she literally can do nothing. Attempting to impersonate an emu at a funeral may be inappropriate, but that doesn't mean that it isn't an option.</p>
<p>Boredom stems from the situation where none of the possible things that a person can do realistically appeal to the person in question. This renders the person inactive, and generally unhappy. Thus, boredom is the result of having nothing to do that one likes.</p>
<p>Also, it is required that the person be at a relative state of rest, and under a low level of pressure to be bored. If the options open to a person are not appealing to a person because all of them involve being killed in some unpleasant way, then he or she is not bored. They are probably in panic, and most likely, doomed.</p>
<p>However, the closeness of definition between being bored and being doomed (the difference apparently only being the level of risk involved) should be noted. This resemblance is what causes most people to despair when faced with the prospect of being bored; it has almost all the elements of being doomed.</p>
