<p>An advertisement said:</p>
<pre>
          "Have a BLAST with BALLOON ANIMALS!!
           Impress your friends and be the center of attention!"
</pre>
<p>Or, I might say, get mistaken for a clown.</p>
<p>The Internet Truth-In-Advertising committee has issued the following advisory in the wake of this advertisement:</p>
<p>Contrary to what some recent balloon animal suppliers' bombastic advertising may have lead you to believe, the International Social Acceptability Standards (ISAS) committee's rating scale still remains:</p>
<p>1. Movie Stars<br>
2. Major Political Figures<br>
3. TV Stars<br>
4. Millionaire Playboys</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<pre>
426. Frisbee-catching Dog trainers
427. Jugglers
428. Clowns (non-big feet &amp; flower)
429. Contortionists
429. Balloon Animal Sculptors         &lt;=== NOTE: CONSIDERABLY LESS COOL
430. Clowns (big feet &amp; flower)                  THAN MOVIE STAR.
431. Mimes
432. Professional Panhandlers
</pre>
<p>Note, however that "<strong>Obscene</strong> Balloon Animal Sculptor" can be rated as high as 257 when used "for cocktail party entertainment only." (ISAS Code Sec. 17, para 129, ammended 12 Oct. 1994) <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
