<p>The Moon is the largest satellite of Earth. It is also a pretty bad place to go for a quick curry after coming out of the pub at closing time. Restaurant critics report that the place has no waiter service, no poppadams or mango chutney, and no atmosphere. You will have no trouble parking at the moon, however the initial transport to the moon is a bit of a problem. There are no scheduled commuter flights for the next 25 years. [Source: NASA]</p>
