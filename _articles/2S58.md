<p>Einstein was the first Earthling to start to figure out some of God's "Universal Glitches", i.e. the finite/infinite speed of light; that time is the fourth dimension (we are still a bit confused by that one, but hey, this is Earth we're talking about...); that space, like so many other things in our lives, often gets bent; and that "Imagination is more important than Intelligence."</p>
<p>The least known fact about Einstein is that he is <strong>not</strong> dead! Einstein, while investigating why light is <strong>so</strong> damned fast, accidentally accelerated himself <strong>past</strong> the speed of light (a feat we still don't know how he accomplished), and was picked up on Jagulon Beta by a pleasure cruiser some days later... He is now running a small bar and grill on Betelguese IV. The service is great, but he uses <strong>way</strong> too much bratwurst.</p>
