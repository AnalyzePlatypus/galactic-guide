<p>An acronym is an abbreviation which sounds like it could be a word on its own. And an abbreviation is a short way of saying something longer with a smaller set of characters than was necessary without the abbreviation.</p>
<p>Here is an example of an acronym, FUBAR = Fucked up beyond all recognition. You say FUBAR as a word on its own.</p>
<p>Here is an example of an abbreviation, TLA = Three letter acronym. You don't say TLA as a word, instead you say the three letters one at the time.</p>
<p>For a list of abbreviations (where some are acronyms) check out my article titled <em>Abbreviations, List Of</em>.</p>
