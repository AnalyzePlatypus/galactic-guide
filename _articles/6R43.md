<p>If you hang around the kind of person who spends much of their time high (as a hitchhiker is apt to do), the names Beavis and Butthead may come up, or if the names don't, your newfound friends may start chuckling like morons at the slightest things and chanting "Fire! Fire! Fire!", or labelling things as "Cool" and "Sucks". There is, believe it or not, a reason for this other than dope and alcohol induced stupor. "Beavis and Butthead" is a television show on MTV, and, bar Barney and Power Rangers, is likely to be one of the stupidest shows around.</p>
<p>The show centers around, naturally, Beavis and Butthead <a href="#footnote-body.1" name="footnote-link.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>, a pair of perpetually laughing teens/couch potatoes. With an animation style consistent with a cracked Walt Disney, aka Mike Judge, the duo travel around their neighborhood and school doing some of the stupidest and most cruel things around (The animation that started the series was called "Frog Baseball").</p>
<p>So, if you like this sort of thing, feel free to watch, it's on at 10 EST on MTV. If not, bless you.</p>
