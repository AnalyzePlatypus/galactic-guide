<p>Few people will argue that Imperial College students are an apathetic bunch wherever anything other than college work (or drinking) is concerned. A most interesting exception to this is the club BLISS. This was recently rediscovered in an old union handbook but unfortunately the society no longer exists. The following was a piece of their publicity which is being republished without the author's permission in the hope that the society is restarted.</p>
<blockquote>Creased and supple, subtle crack<br>
Dull, yet vital vibrant black<br>
Worn through time as aeons pass<br>
Of bikes and bondage, speed and grass<br>
Caught forever, caged in mind<br>
Thongs to keep the darker kind<br>
For speed and victory, power and lust<br>
No doubt there is the black to trust.
<p>Worn with care, holds wrist and arm<br>
Black is power, beauty, charm<br>
Senses sharpened, muscles keyed<br>
Disgrace to mercy, cowards plead<br>
Wrapped and knotted, skin tight fit<br>
Hugging body, soothing wit<br>
Conscience clothed, triumphant kiss<br>
One with honour, yours truly, BLISS.</p>
