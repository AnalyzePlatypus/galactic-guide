<p>St Albert was the site of a major archaeological dig that uncovered the remains of what they now believe to be a 3,000 year-old hamburger. The area, in which no previous discoveries of this kind have been made, was once thought to have housed an ancient marketplace.</p>
<p>The hamburger, though quite obviously inedible now, has been transferred to a nearby research institute, where scientists are currently trying to unlock its secrets, in the hope that they might one day be able to recreate the burger as it once was. Its external appearance seems to suggest that it had been previously cooked several times, and thoroughly steamed to remove the last vestiges of flavour <a href="#footnote-body.1" name="footnote-link.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>. Unfortunately, due to the very nature of the discovery, bite-sized pieces of it have since began to go missing on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The excavation still continues, at this time, as the encouragement of the first discovery has urged many to believe that there is still more to be found. Their major hope is that we will, one day, discover how this ancient civilisation actually lived and survived for so long, or if they survived at all.</p>
<p>This discovery has been placed as the most significant since the great Pizza of St Louis and the Milkshake of Staines, which now appear in the Museum of Paris, displayed alongside other relics that are thought to have dated from the same era.</p>
