<div>
<p>Grantchester is a pleasant village on the river Cam, slightly to the south west of Cambridge. It boasts several pubs with beer gardens. If a more sober repast is required, The Orchard has a tea room and garden - complete with deck chairs, Earl Grey Tea, huge slices of chocolate cake, not to mention scones, cream, and jam. This is a most relaxing environment for a chat, or just a sun bath; however do not expect peace and quiet as you will probably be surrounded by screaming kids.</p>
<p>The Orchard is a perfect place for writing PGG articles or reading a book, but if you try to do either of those things whilst sitting with friends they are bound to take the piss out of you.</p>
