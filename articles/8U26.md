<p>Phenomenon:� the red button, a tantalizing thing to press.</p>
<p>Description:� shiny, candy apple red, round, usually set into some sort of surface.</p>
<p>Explanation:� if you stick a person and a shiny red button in a room, they are more than likely to come in contact sooner or later.� Humans are attracted to red buttons, partly out of curiosity and partly because they want to take a risk.� The shiny red button holds a sense of mystery for the will-be-pressing person.� It has to be pressed.� Shiny red buttons <em>could</em> either kill you, erase you, destroy the universe, send you across the galaxy, change your personality, or make you a very happy carbon based life form.� Shiny red buttons are just plain irresistible to anyone that may come across one and will eventually get pressed. <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
