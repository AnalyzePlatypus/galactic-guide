<p>Exaggeration. Blowing something out of proportion. For example...</p>
<blockquote>"Hey buddy, you want that jelly donut?"<br>
"Umm, yes. I bought it, didn't I..."<br>
"Well, yeah you did. I was just thinking about that jelly donut. You know what they put in those things, don't you?" "No, what do they put in these donuts?"
<p>(Terribly disgusting and exaggerated story about donut making.)</p>
<p>"Oh really? I didn't know that... that's very sick and disgusting. I think I'll puke now. Would you hold my donut?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thereby you gain a donut, and your unfortunate victim looses his lunch.</p>
<p>The best way to exaggerate is to make the thing your exaggerating so unbelievable that there is no way to refute it. This technique works well, unless you can't maintain your believe-ability. If you don't look like you believe in what your talking about, they won't either. Exaggeration is an ability that works best when you've practiced it. Look around. If there is someone nearby, go up to them and try to convince them that salmon really don't swim upstream, it just looks that way. That it's a government plot to keep tourists coming to nature reserves. Some good lines would be:</p>
<blockquote>"Have you ever seen a salmon swim upstream? Do you know why they would swim upstream?"<br>
"No, they just do."<br>
"Oh, they've convinced you too..."</blockquote>
<p>Remember, sincerity! <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
