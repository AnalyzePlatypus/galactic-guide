<p>The phrase "Soushe Awwl Atissu!" is pronounced in the same way as the three English words: "All," "Sushi," and "Ah - Tishoo!" [The observant among you may of course notice that the word "Sushi" is not English but is in fact a form of Japanese raw fish, and that "Ah - Tishoo!" is not even a word at all but more an exclamation of irritation to the nasal passages.]</p>
<p>The origins of this phrase vary depending on which drunk you are talking to, let alone which pub, planet, time zone, and dimension in time and space you happen to be in. The general meaning, however, is remarkably similar wherever you are and is perhaps one of the most widely-known phrases in the galaxy. [The second most widely known "phrase" in the galaxy is the hand gesture of the clenched fist and out-thrust thumb waving by a roadside - or galactic spaceway. The <em>most</em> widely known "phrase" in the galaxy is the clenched fist with a different digit out-stretched.]</p>
<p>The phrase "Soushe Awwl Atissu!" can be summarized as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"I really like your t-shirt"</blockquote>
<p>It does have various connotations, usually implied by the t-shirt referred to. Examples are:</p>
<pre>
          "I think it is really funny"
          "I think it is really sick"
          "I totally agree with your political statement"
          "It reminds me of the good TV shows of my youth"
          "It reminds me of the bad TV shows of my youth"
          "It advertises popular music of today"
          "It really compliments your figure"
          "The wet glistening goo dripping off your front makes me want to
           rub my hands all over your [_insert species specifics here_].
           Can I take your t-shirt off and take you home?"
