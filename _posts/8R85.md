<p>In the 1970s, the founding parents of the Chaos Theory began to manipulate non-linear equations often dealing with meteorology.� Since then Chaos Theory has found wide acceptance in all areas of science, business, and even popular culture.</p>
<p>Chaos is formally defined as the study of complex non-linear dynamic systems.</p>
<p>��������� Complex:� a multitude of variables and equations within equations. ��������� Non-linear:� the equation cannot be solved like your program code. ��������� Dynamic:� ever-changing, depending upon perspective.</p>
<p>If this sounds confusing up to the point of being chaotic, yet at the same time seems to define real life, you're getting the hang of it!</p>
<p>The pragmatic effect of Chaos is that sciences, through non-linear mapping, are better able to work together in conditions that are corrupted by living systems.� Consider two researchers, a physicist (incidentally a rabbi), and a biologist (okay.. yes he's a priest).� The rabbi is studying wild ducks' flight ability, while the priest is intrigued with wild ducks' mating habits.� Ordinarily, if these two met each other on the local pond, they would do little more than raise a few pointed theological questions.</p>
<p>The local mathematician (a minister), however, finds a way to explain the data discrepancies the two researchers have hitherto blamed on corrupted data caused by non-laboratory conditions.��Thanks to Chaos Theory they create an equation that explains why wild duck flight patterns become more erratic (read:� erotic) during mating season.� On a side note, they could not find an equation that could incorporate all religions and/or Saturday morning cartoons.</p>
<p>This sort of cooperation occurs every day with the help of the life-describing non-linear equation.� To the date of this edition of the guide, however, no equation has yet equaled 42.�;-) <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
