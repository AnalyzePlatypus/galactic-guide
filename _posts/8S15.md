<p>What should you do if a meteorite lands in your field? Do not:</p>
<ul>
<li>stand directly under the path of the falling rock.</li>
<li>investigate during the hours of darkness.</li>
<li>send farmhands to investigate during the hours of darkness.</li>
<li>send farmhands to investigate during the hours of daylight.</li>
<li>call any nuclear physicists who may be on holiday nearby.</li>
<li>stand around saying "Ooh, look, the top's unscrewing." Serious flash burns may result.</li>
<li>intone the phrase "Klatu Barada Nikto" for any reason.</li>
<li>call the Army.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do:</p>
<ul>
<li>adopt infants found near the site of the impact.</li>
<li>carry flashlights.</li>
<li>run away if flashlights unexpectedly go out.</li>
<li>check returning farmhands for signs that they are still human.</li>
<li>check out all local greenhouses for tall bell-shaped flowers and/or giant seed pods.</li>
<li>make sure at least one of any investigating party has a cold.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seriously, I guess that the best people to get into contact with would be the geology department of your local university, or your local natural history museum. If they can't help directly, they should know someone who can. <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
