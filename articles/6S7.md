<p>The telephone was invented by Sir Alexander Bell. In his first experiment he contacted his assistant in the other room. What history does not recall is that the first telephone call was infact a wrong number to an old lady of sixty-five, living in Wolverhampton.</p>
<p>Things have gone down hill rapidly since then.</p>
<p>Recently the evil megacorporation that is British Telecom changed the majority of telephone codes by one single number. The side effect of this simple exercise was to increase the chances of dialing a wrong number by a factor of three hundred and seventy two thousand, six hundred and fifty nine.</p>
<p>The simple problem of this is that most people believe the number of the beast to be 666. It is not. The real number of the beast is 5435356584645. Ask for Clive after six o'clock. The only possible result is world wide ragnarok!!</p>

[editor's note: the description of British Telecom as the "Evil
 Megacorporation" is purely the opinion of this field researcher and not
 of the Project Galactic Guide Editors.  Besides, everyone knows that the
 "Evil Megacorporation" is Microsoft and not BT.]
