footnotes: {"[1]":"Regurgitating life forms are politely requested to try the single scoop cone.","[2]":"Malaroonian Butt-silk, like its name suggests, comes from the butts of the Malaroonian Silk Worm. Unfortunately, the precious silk can only be excreted when massive pressure is applied to the worms fragile head. As a result, the worms were almost driven to extinction by the ridiculously large amount of ruthless fashion designers that live in the area. Now one of the Universe's three protected species [3], only small amount of these worms are allowed to be collected for each upcoming fashion season.","[3]":"The protected species list was shortened from three-hundred trillion to three after it was realized the massive amount of trees that were being destroyed for the paper used to keep the protected species list updated. Indeed, over four-hundred galaxies became uninhabitable due to massive amounts of defoliation."}

<p>The Malaroonian Star System is possibly one of the most unpopular of all tourist star systems. This is mainly due to it not being a tourist star system, but this should not deter hitchhikers who are looking to see everything everywhere.</p>
<pre>
Key export:          Malaroonian Butt-silk.
Official languages:  Malaroonian, Common Trade, and Spanish.

<p>The following are a few great places to visit:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">There is a very good shopping planet, known as the "small shopping planet", where many good quality items may be purchased cheaply. Highly recommended is a really, really good flavor of ice cream known as Friple-Cocoa-Flip. The Royal Upheaval, an oversized sundae containing fifty-two scoops of Friple-Cocoa-Flip, is recommended for life forms that do not easily regurgitate <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>.</li>
<li value="2">The Malaroonian Butt-silk <a href="#footnotes.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a> factory. Not the monster production factory it once was. However, tours are still available at low group rates.</li>
<li value="3">The Royal Palace at Halabaloo. Constructed as a wedding gift for Prince Virulent and her lady Stephanie, this beautiful and massive building is almost a planet in itself. People requesting tours will be dismembered by the palace guard, so any tours are best taken from a very high orbit.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many more sights to see while in Malaroon, so be creative. Swing by that frozen looking planet. Duck down that dark alley. What could it hurt?</p>
