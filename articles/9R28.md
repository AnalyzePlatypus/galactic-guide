<p>The Order of the Knights of the Command Line is an organisation that aims to protect the traditions and culture of computing. They hold as central beliefs that: a command line interface is the difference between a computer and a toy, command line arguments are cool, and batch files and shell scripts are media for artistic self-expression.</p>
<p>Brussels House, being the First House, was founded on the seventeenth of March of the year 1997. Prospective founders of a House (or Chapter) need to have their Quest approved by the Grand Cursors, the Dukes of the First House. A Quest can be porting a piece of software to DOS or Linux, or anything to further the success of command line interfaces and thwart the Evil Realm of the Mouse.</p>
<p>At the time of writing there are several Houses in Belgium and Germany; more Chapters are expected to be founded in the near future. The Knights of the Command Line can be reached at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130205234251/http://knights.rave.org/">http://knights.rave.org</a>.</p>
