<p>As the hitchhiker is always looking for ways to avoid having to hand out their money, here are some tips to get things for free!</p>
<h3>FREE COKE</h3>
<p>Go to your local convenience store. While the store clerk isn't looking, grab some coke and run for it. NOTE: If you bring a weapon, you can even do it while they're looking.</p>
<h3>FREE TELEPHONE CALLS</h3>
<p>Call from work.</p>
<h3>FREE PIZZA</h3>
<p>Hang around the dumpster outside your favorite pizza joint. When they close, they'll bring out all of the bizarre unsellable cold pizzas that various jokers ordered during the day - wait until they're gone and grab them! Free pizza!</p>
<h3>FREE FIREWOOD</h3>
<p>Look in the newspaper for ads saying "Free Firewood, you haul away." Haul it away.</p>
<h3>FREE ATTENTION</h3>
<p>Post the "MAKE MONEY FAST" article to the newsgroup of your choice. You'll have hundreds of email friends within a week, and your news admin will too!</p>
