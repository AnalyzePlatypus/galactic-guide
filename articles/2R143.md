<h3>Dubious Metrics</h3>
<p>A millihelen is the amount of beauty required to launch one ship.</p>
<p>A microhelen is the amount of beauty required to motivate one sailor.</p>
<p>A megahelen is the amount of beauty required to make the sailor think in any other terms than a one-night stand.</p>
<p>But this is all rather bogus, since we are applying metric prefixes to Troy units.</p>
