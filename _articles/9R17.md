    text: "Imagine trying to calculate the weather on a computer. You would have to put in every little obstacle flowing air can encounter. Large buildings are easy, but what about twigs, scraps of paper, grains of sand? Not to mention moving things like insects. What&apos;s the point of this argument? Well, merely: don&apos;t bother trying this at home, folks!"

<p>In the past years, many attempts have been made to gain the power to change the weather. In the present century, developments in physics and mathematics have led us to the realisation that we already possess it.</p>
<p>The relatively new field of Chaos Theory is often illustrated by the example of the "storm butterfly". The motions of the wings of a butterfly above Area 51, Nevada, USA, for instance, can eventually cause a storm in the Bermuda triangle <a href="#footnote-body.1" name="footnote-link.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>. This example shows how seemingly insignificant distortions of a system can have large consequences on the state of the system later on.</p>
<p>It also shows that every move we make will some time or other have an effect on that amazingly complex system we call weather <a href="#footnote-body.2" name="footnote-link.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a>. We can choose to stand still in the wind, wave our arms frantically as if to fly, or fart; the effects will all be different.</p>
<p>With this we see that without much effort we can influence the development of the weather in the future.</p>
<p><em>Control</em> of the weather, now that's another thing...</p>
