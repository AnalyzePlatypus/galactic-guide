<p>This Net Cafe is located at 82 Boat Quay in Singapore. To find it, follow the Boat Quay signs from the Raffles' Place MRT station, fight your way past everyone trying to drag you into their bars and restaurants, then it's almost at the end on the left.</p>
<p>They have lots of PCs running Windows 95, with the main boxes hidden away in cupboards under the counter. They are happy to let you use the floppy drives if you want to upload or download mail from a remote account via ftp. They also have a video camera mounted on the wall, so that if your net.friends are on-line they can watch you on the cafe Web site (at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130117015614/http://mondrian.smedia.com.sg/">http://mondrian.smedia.com.sg/</a>). Each machine seems to have its own camera attached but I didn't play with them at all.</p>
<p>Prices are quite cheap at S$10 (about $8) per hour, and food and drink prices are good for Singapore too. The Net connection is very fast (128 kilobits per second or above, I guess), taking only a few seconds to download my inbox from California.</p>
