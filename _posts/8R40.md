<p>"X", on the whole, is a fairly unpopular letter of the alphabet in the English language, as many words and names suspiciously avoid it, preferring a nicely rounded "O" or the versatility of an "S". It is because of this that the designated section of an English dictionary, containing words beginning with "X" usually amasses no more than one page <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Lately it has become more fashionable to use the letter "X" in many names and words because its "uniqueness" is thought to expand from the confines of one letter to encompass the entire sentence. Also, it has been used to replace a "cs", which some have described as "dated", but many others have pointed out that these people are just lazy, or ignorant, or both.</p>
<p>If somebody names a company, or themselves, a name beginning with "X", it is more than likely that they are attempting to become the first people on that particular page in the telephone directory. It is therefore necessary, when meeting these people, to concede all arguments to them because they are obviously on some sort of ego-trip <a href="#footnotes.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the nature of language, this article would be almost totally invalid if translated into any language in which X is a popular, if there is such a language. In those instances, substitute "X" for the relevant rarely-used letter, if one exists <a href="#footnotes.3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a>.</p>
