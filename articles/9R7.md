<p>It seemed like a good idea at the time. In fact, looking back, it still seems like a pretty good idea <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>. Picture the boredom of youth, or even youths. Picture the boredom of youths sitting around drinking. Picture the boredom of youths sitting around drinking, looking at the fire-break running around the property, and thinking, "Wouldn't it be nice if...?" Picture three of these youths getting a couple of hundred bucks together, leafing through the paper, and buying the cheapest running car they could find.</p>
<p>Now picture <a href="#footnotes.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a> the same lads, spending a weekend thrashing the car around the track, running it into trees, and generally having a wow of a time as is the want of lads (and lasses) of that age.</p>
<p>Thus was born the tradition of Boomshanka <a href="#footnotes.3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a>. This first car, an old blue HK Kingswood with a Teddybear screwed to the bonnet, was Christened "Boomshanka I". Imaginatively, the next two cars, a Fiat 128 and a Holden Torana respectively, were Christened "Boomshanka II" and "Boomshanka III". Boomshanka IV was a Venetian Gondola, but that's another story.</p>
