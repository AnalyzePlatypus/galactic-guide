<p>Back in <em>my</em> days, we didn't have handy dandy power cords and electrical outlets to plug them in to. We had to hand crank our computers to start them up. Lots of times the crank would stick, so you'd have to give it a good kick to get it loose. That's why, to this day, it's still called "booting" a computer.</p>
