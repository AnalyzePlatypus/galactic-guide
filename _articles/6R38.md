<p>Ever seen the "Landmark" of Brussels? A two foot high black statue of a boy pissing into a pond. Where's the artistic merit in that? I saw souvenir shops selling replicas that were <em>twice</em> the size of the real thing. But, ask a tourist what the landmark of Brussels is, and he will surely point to this statue, rather than the beautiful and artistic palace facade in the main square.</p>
