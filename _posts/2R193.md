<p>The last few Halloweens I think I've done some permanent psychological damage to some young'ns who come begging 8~).</p>
<p>I used to dress up as Dracula and go for their necks before I give the candy. I stopped doing that when they started pissing on my porch. Two years ago I hid in the bushes right by the door and bandaged up my arm. As the little ones walked by, I'd grab at their ankles. I could never reach or even touch them, but they too started wetting their pants and some parents got upset. Come on! It's Halloween, you're supposed to get scared!</p>
<p>This year, I'm living in a house with a lot of really weird people. We have a lot of big trees in front of our house and we got a lot of leaves which we piled up really high. Two guys hid in the pile. I would sneak up behind the little beggars and pretend to be tricker treating with them. When I passed by the pile of leaves, the two guys grabbed my legs and dragged me in kicking and screaming.</p>
<p>You've never seen kids run so fast in your life.</p>
<p>In all cases I think we left a permanent scar on their psyche. Ya! <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
