<p>The periodic comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke up into about 21 pieces, and ended up plowing into Jupiter's atmosphere about three weeks into July of 1994. The largest of the 21 fragments, fragment G, was two miles in diameter, and hit Jupiter at 130,000 miles per hour, on July 19th. The force of the impact was estimated to be approximately equivalent to 6 teratons (that's 6,000,000 megatons) of TNT.</p>
<p>If you had a home on Shoemaker-Levy 9, you should start filing with your insurance company now. If you were in the process of buying property on Shoemaker-Levy 9, back out of the deal now. It's just not there anymore.</p>
