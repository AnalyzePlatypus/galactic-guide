<p>Useful Items of Hitch-hikers apparel: Sunglasses.</p>
<p>Maybe the sunglasses also bear further description. They were the fashionable "yachty" style sunglasses, roundish Reflect-o sunglasses with little leather flaps that came back to cover the sides of the eyes, making them a little bit like goggles. I had, of course, modified these sunglasses, by taking off the arms, and attaching a loop of elastic to the leather flaps. This made them completely like goggles, had the added benefit that I could sleep with them on, and I never had to worry about breaking the arms, the most fragile point of a pair of sunnies.</p>
