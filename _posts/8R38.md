<p>Much of life involves a level of commitment that many people are totally unable, or perhaps just unwilling, to make. Inability to do so can be the result of circumstances and is usually specific to the actual commitment involved, but unwillingness, though this can be specific too, is generally a certain apathy towards things in general.</p>
<p>The major clues when you are attempting to identify apathy, are the casual "Oh, I can't be bothered," or the deceptively unhelpful and probably dishonest, "Oh, I'll do it later." These comments will usually be made when the relevant person is virtually inactive <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Combating apathy can be difficult, whether you are the passive being in question, or merely the observer. The former would have to <em>want</em> to overcome their apathy which, considering the nature of such, is unlikely to be the case. The latter can attempt to induce enthusiasm through various activities, preferably relevant to the eventual task you wish them to undertake. This is usually difficult, but in extreme circumstances possible.</p>
<p>If you are in a position where your life depends on the positive <a href="#footnotes.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a> actions of an apathetic person, then it is probably a good idea to make peace with yourself and whatever you believe in, while you still can.</p>
