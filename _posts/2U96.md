<p>The Malebolgia is as very close to pure evil as one might encounter, short of meeting Evil Incarnate. It resides in Hell in the Eight Sphere, dubbed "the Malebolge" after it defeated the previous resident, another unknown devil, sometime in the past.</p>
<p>You don't want to meet the Malebolgia. You don't want to hike through the Malebolge. Be a good hitchhiker. Obey your parents and all posted speed limits.</p>
<p>Malebolgia is of interest for both it's seemingly fathomless capacity for evil and it's creation of hellspawns. It has created an army of hellspawns (see Spawn) throughout time-space which it plans to use in battle against the forces of Heaven at Armageddon.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, some patches of time-space actually sell action figures of the Malebolgia. They are limited to extremely small production runs, causing collectors and other assorted riff-raff to seek after them all the more ardently. Memo Diligent, a world-class collector, reportedly spent the price of say... Iowa on the famed variation "Malebolgia with small yellow fleck of paint."</p>
