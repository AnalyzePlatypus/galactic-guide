<h3>Overview (possible spoiler warning)</h3>
<p>Cute girls, machine guns, mad scientists, zombies, bad acting, and special effects - what more could you ask for in a B-movie? Our two heroines are stuck at home with their mother while their father is off being a mercenary in Central America, when, conveniently, about fifteen minutes into the movie everyone else drops down dead after watching a comet go by (except for the ones who turn into cannibal zombies - though, of course, many of them didn't have far to go - and the obligatory mad scientists in an underground bunker somewhere in the desert).</p>
<p>Following The-End-Of-The-World-As-We-Know-It(tm), the girls settle down to a simple life of riding motorbikes, avoiding zombies, karate, shopping, shooting things with automatic weapons, and fighting over the last living man on Earth. Then the mad scientists appear and they get an excuse to blow some things up too. Ah, definitely my kind of girls....</p>
<p>All in all, it's not a bad way to pass a couple of hours on a rainy afternoon, and bizarre as it may sound, after about the fifteenth viewing the plot actually does begin to make some sense.</p>
