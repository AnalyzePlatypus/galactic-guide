<h3>History</h3>
<p>From the Creek word for "river of blood," Chickamauga is the site of one of the bloodiest battles of the civil war. This battle was particularly significant in history as paving the way for "Sherman's March" through Georgia which allowed the destruction of one of the major strongholds of the South, Atlanta.</p>
<h3>Sightseeing/Tourist Attractions</h3>
<p>There is a military park on the battleground, with periodical reenactments, there are bicycle trails, historical monuments, and on Independence Day there is a symphonic presentation known as "Pops In The Park."</p>
<h3>Spots to Avoid</h3>
<p>The actual city of Chickamauga, which is worse than Twin Peaks. There is one red light, five or six Barney Fife look-alikes, and a whole slew of Deliverance types.</p>
<h3>Avoid at All Costs</h3>
<p>A man with a big nose named "Sonny Day." Experiences delusions of grandeur concerning the town of Chickamauga and his particular role in it (Principal of local school).</p>
