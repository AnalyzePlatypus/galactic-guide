<p>Of the more stupid pastimes of the world, perhaps one of the least advisable is Fountain Diving. This is a tradition during the San Fermin festival in Pamplona, for those whom the threat of 1000kg of rampaging bull no longer produces an adequate adrenaline rush.</p>
<pre>
Requirements: - A fountain, not very deep, with a high column or statue in
                the middle.
              - A group of (preferably large and trustworthy) people to
                stand in the fountain.
              - A deathwish is not essential, but beneficial.
</pre>
<pre>
Procedure:   - Simple.  Climb the statue, and jump into the waiting arms
               of those below.  Extra points are awarded for a pike or a
               tuck on the way down.
</pre>
<pre>
Pit-falls:   - Any time the correct juxtaposition of events occurs to
               allow fountain diving, there is a high likelihood that most
               of the participants will be drunk.  Drunk people have a
               notoriously short attention span.  Figure out the results
               for yourself!
