# Revive Project Galactic Guide

So this is it! I haven't enough things to do already, so I'm going to try to revive Project Galactic Guide (which I have _greatly_ enjoyed in the past). Here's the plan:

## The Plan

1. ✅ Download the last available version content from Archive.org
2. ✅ Convert the articles into Markdown
3.    Wrap the whole in a Jekyll theme
4.    Publish the lot to GitHub pages!


Todo: 
* Create article ID -> article title & link filter
* Create 'factuality' (Real | SemiReal | UnReal) -> link filter
* Custom 404 page
* Activate the theme
* Add the logo
* Custom styling
* Pagination for collection pages

Pages:
* Author page
