<p>The growth of Ambient Music over recent years has been matched by the upsurgence of ambient videos. This started with artistic films of aquariums and waves rolling over the sea shore. This developed into videos taken from inside cars which would drive around the M25 Greater London ring road. For train spotters, there are videos of complete train journeys.</p>
