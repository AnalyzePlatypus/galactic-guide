<h2>What Is A Wolf?</h2>
<p>A wolf is a large carnivorous mammal, and a member of the dog family. Wolves come in a number of species and sizes, with 100 pounds being considered large. Wolves in captivity can live to be 15 or 16 years old, much like a domestic dog; this is unsurprising as the domestic dog has been down bred over several millennia from original wolf stock. However, in the wild, wolves are lucky to live beyond eight or nine years.</p>
<p>Wolves are similar in appearance to German Shepherd Dogs (Alsatians) but with a shallower chest, broader head with a conspicuous ruff of hair around cheeks, and with a shorter and thicker neck. The fur colouration varies including grey/greyish fawn with brown-reddish colour on the back and the head/ears (especially in Italy). Northern wolves may have a reddish tinge on their head, ears, shoulders, and legs, but not on their backs.</p>

<h2>Different Species</h2>
<p>There are two main species of wolf: the grey wolf (canis lupus), and the red wolf (canis rufus) <a href="#footnote-body.#appendix.1" name="footnote-link.#appendix.1" class="footnote-link">#appendix.1</a>. All other wolves are subspecies of these two species.</p>
<p>The grey wolf tribe is the most common, and includes such wolves as the timber wolf <a href="#footnote-body.#appendix.2" name="footnote-link.#appendix.2" class="footnote-link">#appendix.2</a>, tundra wolf, lobo wolf, and the arctic wolf <a href="#footnote-body.#appendix.3" name="footnote-link.#appendix.3" class="footnote-link">#appendix.3</a>.</p>
<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>Wolves are opportunistic feeders accustomed to a feast-famine existence. They often go for many days without eating and then gorge as much as twenty pounds in a single sitting, and as such will eat anything that moves. This includes large prey such as: deer, elk, caribou and, in some areas, moose and bison weighing up to 1000 pounds (ten times their own weight), rabbits, rodents, birds, and carrion. Human garbage can be important in some areas (such as Italy).</p>
<p>Red wolves have a broadly similar diet with more emphasis on the smaller prey species.</p>
<h2>A Wolf's Year</h2>
<h3>Spring</h3>
<p>Cubs born only to dominant female (ledrene). She is dependent upon the rest of the pack for food for the next three weeks.</p>
<p>Within two months of birth, the cubs are weaned, and eating solid food. They are now one third adult size.</p>
<h3>Summer</h3>
<p>When the cubs are eight to ten weeks old, the adults round them up and herd them a few miles cross-country to a pre-chosen location. As soon as the trip is over, the cubs, exhausted from their first long-distance foray, flop down and go to sleep. For the next few months, this will be the pack's summer home and open air nursery.</p>
<p>The parental care given by the leader and ledrene strongly imprints their dominant position in the minds of the cubs. On growing up, they will find it difficult to challenge their parent's authority. Their relationship is, to the leader and ledrene, similar to the relationship between a dog puppy and its owner. The cub treats its owner as if he or she is a dominant wolf. Even when grown to full size and strength, the dog still regards its owner as dominant.</p>
<p>Training in hunting techniques begins in late summer, when the pack starts taking the cubs out to hunt with them.</p>
<h3>Autumn</h3>
<p>By now, the cubs will have received lessons on communication and marking by scent, and on the meaning of territory. They will have discovered that their pack lives in a well-defined area and that rival wolf packs have territories in adjacent areas. This is a critical point to understand; if a wolf trespasses into another pack's range, it may be killed.</p>
<p>The cubs will now be learning how to communicate through howling. Howling enables packs to broadcast their claim to territory and discourage trespassing.</p>
<p>The territorial system acts as a mechanism regulating wolf populations. The number of good territories is limited, as is the number of wolves that a territory can sustain. Under natural conditions, the availability of space and food controls the wolf population.</p>
<h3>Winter</h3>
<p>Winter can be a time of relative plenty for wolves, as prey find it harder to forage through the snow and are gradually weakened, lessening their chances if hunted.</p>
<p>By now, the nine month old cubs are nearly adult size in body height, but still need a year to fill out their frames.</p>
<p>For most packs, the breeding season starts in February. The first sign of this is a dramatic renewal of pair bonding by the leader and ledrene. Both of them forsake many of their normal activities so they can spend more time together. They also become more aggressive towards other adults in the pack, both challenging any wolves that attempt a mating. Normally the ledrene succeeds, and she will be the only female to produce cubs.</p>
<h2>Red Wolves (Canis Rufus)</h2>
<p>Red wolves are medium sized canids similar in appearance to coyotes, but more robust <a href="#footnote-body.#appendix.1" name="footnote-link.#appendix.1" class="footnote-link">#appendix.1</a>. Their legs and ears are relatively long, compared with the coyote's, and the colouration is similar, though more tawny and coarser. Red wolves are slightly smaller than greys, with a more slender elongated head and shorter, coarser fur. Unless otherwise stated, all the facts in this article can be applied equally to grey and red wolves. The map only shows the current distribution of grey wolves, as red wolves are extinct in the wild.</p>
<p>The red wolf was once found throughout the south-eastern United States, from the Atlantic coast to central Texas and from the Gulf Coast to central Missouri and southern Illinois. Between the period of 1900 to 1920, red wolves were exterminated from most of the eastern portion of their range. A small number persisted in the wild in south-eastern Texas and south-western Louisiana until the late 1970s. By 1980, it was determined that the species was extinct in the wild.</p>
<p>The present red wolf population of at least 249 animals exists primarily in captivity. Two hundred animals are located in 22 captive breeding facilities in the United States.</p>
