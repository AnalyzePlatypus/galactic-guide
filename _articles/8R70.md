<p>Politicians are large, disgusting creatures which draw power to themselves by power of advertising, untruthfulness, and completely faked hoopiness. As they are also skilled liars, the successful members of this species can survive by convincing a majority of the people that they have been in an identical situation to them, and thus can appreciate all of their own worst attributes which, for the average politician, at last count, is all of them.</p>
<p>Their realization makes them fall into this line of thinking: "Nothing about me is good. Quick, let's draw up a tax-raise bill so at least I'll be richer." This is, of course, the cause of most bankruptcy, and thus of keeping the entitlement funds afloat.</p>
<p>One of the greatest misnomers in politics is calling a politician a "public servant". This is incorrect because a politician serves only him/herself, and ignores the responsibilities of a servant to the people.</p>
