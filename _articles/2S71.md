<p>Ozone is the substance in the atmosphere which stops you from getting suntans, and skin cancer. If you are in danger from getting too tanned then a towel is recommended as a sunshield. In certain parts of the Earth the ozone layer is extremely thin and in others (eg Los Angeles and London) there is a surplus of ozone. On several planets the ozone layer has been intentionally punctured by towel manufacturing conglomerates in league with the United Aerosol Corporation.</p>
<p>All Homo Sapiens should think twice about getting sun tans even when obtained through a uv electric lamp.</p>
<p>"O-Zone" is also a science fiction novel by travel writer Paul Theroux. Theroux is a well respected novelist in his own genre, however, this researcher seems to be the only human in Britain who actually enjoyed reading this book. <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
