<p>One of the more impossible things you can attempt if bored is trying to get <em>through</em> a mountain, instead of being normal and going over like ordinary people. It has been said that necessity is the mother of invention, but very few people have tried, or even considered trying, this stunt. Therefore, we have no information.</p>
<p>However, we will not leave you empty-handed. Similar to flying, the point is to make physics completely ignore the fact that what you are doing is completely impossible. This could be said for most of the things that are (supposably) impossible. We figure that if you are sufficiently distracted by, say, a nice pair of legs, anything is possible.</p>
<p>In the words of the great (maybe) singer Weird Al, "Dare to be stupid."</p>
