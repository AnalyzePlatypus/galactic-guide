<p>The Mark I Charismatic Autonomous Terminator (CAT) system is a family of intelligent, stealthy, terminal-homing mouse-seeking missiles featuring multi-sensor targeting with dual night-vision devices, and neural-net architecture.</p>
<p>The CAT's self-righting inertial platform allows launch from any attitude. Integrated multi-aspect attack profile with indefinite-loiter mode insure a wide lethality envelope. Upon target engagement, the CAT deploys four clusters of retractable submunitions in addition to the primary warhead, providing an enhanced radius of destruction.</p>
<p>The CAT uses regular or exotic solid or liquid fuel and is equipped with a low-signature exhaust-obscuration system. Firmware and connectors compatible with any unit of the Mark I series guarantee unlimited expansion capability, making the CAT system a cost-effective countermeasure to the projected spectrum of rodent-threat scenarios well into the next century.</p>
<p>The CAT is now available <a href="#footnote-body.1" name="footnote-link.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a> from ACME Anti-Roadrunner Systems Division of McDonald Dynamics. See us at the Paris Air Show, Tom Clancy's next movie, or contact Frank Reid at 855-0711 (day) or 339-7305 (evenings; be patient) for immediate free delivery.</p>
