<p>In the days when Disaster Area was only the nickname for hairdresser's shops and not the later well-known chart-breaking band, this little planet had a problem with a virus called HIV, spreading AIDS.</p>
<p>Many attempts were made to stop this various spreading, until a clean method was developed. This method is called <em>Radio</em>.</p>
<p>R.A.D.I.O. (Reach All Dulls In Order To Keep Them From Fucking Around - the last parts of this abbreviation were later dropped because people believed "Radiotktofa" to be a Russian abuse rather than a medical program) was used to play the most nauseating music available.</p>
<p>Everyone who listened long enough to this repugnant garbage became impotent. And the music was repulsive enough to keep even the viruses from reproducing. So, the scientists had enough time to develop a cure.</p>
<p>A fascinating effect was, many inhabitants of Earth seemed to <em>enjoy</em> this music. They were of course disappointed when - after a cure for AIDS had been found -- the Air Force bombed the transmitters. <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
