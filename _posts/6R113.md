<p>It is widely assumed that a sense of humour is a mark of intelligence that only humans display. This is not true--dolphins also have a sense of humour.</p>
<p>Swimming at the entrance to Salcome Harbour in South Devon, England, UK, a pod of dolphins will lie in wait for unsuspecting boat handlers. Having chosen their victim, they leap into the air to draw attention to themselves, swim under passing boats, and generally create as large an audience as possible. They then centre in on their victim, swimming close to, under, and around his (the victim is usually is a man) boat.</p>
<p>We have to deduce that they are saying in dolphin, "Come play with us".</p>
<p>They are waiting for the moment when he can resist no longer. What happens next is that the human hands the boat controls to another person and then then jumps into the water. The dolphins then swim away from him but stay just close enough for everyone to know that he has been snubbed.</p>
<p>We do not recommend swimming with dolphins. They will always beat you at the 100m freestyle.</p>
