<p>What do Geeks find (or do that is) romantic? There are several things:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Stalking</li>
<li value="2">Wearing night vision goggles while perched in a tree or something (see 1)</li>
<li value="3">Asking a girl out while speaking Klingon, then laughing when she doesn't understand</li>
<li value="4">Calling 1-900 numbers</li>
<li value="5">Finding a teleconferencing BBS and looking for girls</li>
<li value="6">Walking nonchalantly through the lingerie section of Sears 3 or 4 times, sneaking quick furtive glances</li>
<li value="7">Dressing up as a United Federation of Planets ADMIRAL, because hey, chicks dig the people with the highest rank</li>
<li value="8">Setting your digital watch to beep when you're next to some girl and hoping she'll say "Wow Bernard, is that the new Casio GMT-90 with global positioning tracking and indiglo? You're cool!"</li>
<li value="9">Playing some "interactive sex" game on your computer</li>
<li value="10">GIFs! GIFs!</li>
</ol>
