<p>In North-West England there is a Human God who shall be called simply Pseudonym.</p>
<p>The members of the Pseudonym Fan Club feel compelled to inform you about him. They submitted a 1,277 page summary of just what a really great guy he is, and because our office researchers are still trying to fact-check and verify the full document, only the following brief facts can presently be made available. He is devastatingly charming, intelligent, witty, friendly, sociable, amiable, huggable, kissable, lovable, sexy, charming, knowledgeable, funny, caring, thoughtful, desirable, gorgeous. Unreliable reports also say that he is good in bed (presumably this means that he doesn't snore too much).</p>
<p>He is enthusiastic, enigmatic, eccentric, exciting, interesting, intriguing, relaxing, thought-provoking and pleasing, and in short (okay, it's a little late for that), if you're human and female and vaguely attractive then he is EXACTLY the person you want to go out with. In fact he's the kind of person you want to get in touch with right NOW. In two words, he is a Love God.</p>
<p>The Pseudonym fan club currently has only one member (namely the Honorable Pseudonym himself). Watch this space for membership information.</p>
