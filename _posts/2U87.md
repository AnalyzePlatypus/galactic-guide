<p>Randy Andy Hyneline is probably the galaxy's greatest journalist. Keep an eye out for his books in your local bookshop but remember to put it back in before closing time because they have boxes of lost eyeballs.</p>
<p>Winner of the Roger Award, 13 years running, Hyneline came to fame under the Great MegaDodo Publishing House, writing for the under developed parts of the galaxy. He is best known for such great documentary books as:</p>
<blockquote>The Number of the Bugblatter Beast.<br>
Time Enough For Lunch.<br>
The Cat Who Walked Through Windows.<br>
Have No Space Suit - Will Travel 30 seconds.<br>
I Will Fear No Evil, Because I Am Wearing Mirrorshades.</blockquote>
<p>and that classic:</p>
<blockquote>Thursday.</blockquote>
