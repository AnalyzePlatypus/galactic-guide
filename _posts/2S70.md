<p>Personal Stereos are used as sex aids on some worlds <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>, but banned on others as socially unacceptable, because they damage hearing, conversational skills and look silly.</p>
<p>Major features of Personal Stereos include a shiny black metal finish for technofetishists, rubber and metal cable for bondage freaks, and for body piercing fans earphones which are held in place by earrings - or alternatively earphones which are actually embedded in the earlobe. It is unadvisable to lubricate your personal stereo with anything other than isotonic alcohol (the rubber parts only) or "Three-In-One Handy Oil" (the metal parts only). Vaseline is prohibited.</p>
