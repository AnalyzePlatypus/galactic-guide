    text: "These are sword and sorcery type stories written about an alternative planet Earth. Its main criticism is that all the women are subjucated to slaves, dancers, whores etc -- totally politically incorrect. They have become a byword for bad science fiction and fantasy."

<p>Imperial College Science Fiction Society is one of the largest social clubs at Imperial. Its main function is to store a library of more than 2500 books. These are kept at the "ICSF library" which can be found below Beit Quad, at basement level, behind a door with a sign saying "beware of the leopard."</p>
<p>This fact is often lost on first year students who totally fail to find this room, thus failing the second intelligence test of starting college. The first is, of course: "How do I get my library text-books before everyone else?"</p>
<p>The third intelligence test involves members of the opposite sex. Unfortunately, the ICSF library is particularly unsuitable for such enquiry as the male to female ratio usually ranges around the 7 to 1 mark. This is <em>slightly</em> worse than that of Imperial as a whole. (Although I am speaking from the male standpoint I am told that it is just as bad for the female students. Their general solution is to get a steady boyfriend and make sure everyone knows about him.)</p>
<p>There is some debate as to whether the third test involves finding the Union Bar and purchasing large quantities of alcohol. This argument is undecided. However, it is nearby and so rare members of the society can display prowess in both third tests simultaneously.</p>
<p>Communication with the Committee of ICSF is through various primitive means such as face to face verbal communication. In recent years they have discovered email (try "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130117013118/mailto:icsf@imperial.ac.uk">icsf@imperial.ac.uk</a>") and even the World Wide Web (try "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130117013118/http://www.su.ic.ac.uk/">http://www.su.ic.ac.uk/</a>" or "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130117013118/http://www.ph.ic.ac.uk/moontg/">http://www.ph.ic.ac.uk/moontg/</a>").

<p>Under <em>no</em> circumstance should telepathy be tried -- especially transatlantic telepathy. The energy requirements for that fried the brain of the last guy to try it and all he does now is read Gor books <a href="#footnote-body.1" name="footnote-link.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>(definition of a committee:<br>
A creature with more than six legs, and no brain -- Lazarus Long)</p>
<p>The society aims at producing at least one one-day convention per year. It regularly fails to get much enthusiasm from the general bulk of the members who have never been to a science fiction convention.</p>
<p>In case you were wondering, Imperial College is a large part of the University of London. Its E-mail domain is .ic.ac.uk. It's not so bad as long as you choose a course you enjoy.</p>
