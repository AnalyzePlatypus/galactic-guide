<div>
<p>Onomatopoeia refers to a formation of words that imitate or suggest what they stand for, according to my Griffin Dictionary For Kids. That such a simple concept could be given a name that is so difficult to spell gives credence to any theories of Unnatural Complexity which happen to be passing.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of onomatopoeia:</p>
<p>Plop, splash, sploosh, splat, bang, boom, pop, purr, bark, tweet, meow, quack, squeak. These are good examples, as they conjure images of what they represent in the mind.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that the word <em>snore</em> is onomatopoeic, however my experiments have shown that this is only true if you say the word very slowly while gargling with chocolate syrup.</p>
