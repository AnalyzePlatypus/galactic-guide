# Revive Project Galactic Guide

So this is it! I haven't enough things to do already, so I'm going to try to revive Project Galactic Guide (which I have _greatly_ enjoyed in the past). Here's the plan

## The Plan

1. Download the last available version content from Archive.org
2. Convert the articles into Markdown
3. Wrap the whole in a Jekyll theme
4. Publish the lot to GitHub pages!
