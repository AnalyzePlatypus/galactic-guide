<p>Roman Numerals are an ancient way of numbering, involving different symbols, and a slightly different principal from our usual decimal manner. The following key symbols are used:</p>
<p>��������� * I = 1<br>
��������� * V = 5<br>
��������� * X = 10<br>
��������� * L = 50<br>
��������� * C = 100<br>
��������� * D = 500<br>
��������� * M = 1000</p>
<p>They are combined together to form a string, where the progressively decreasing numbers are added together to form a total.� Numbers are generally expressed in descending order, except where the number you wish to express (say 9) is next to the relevant number above (10), in which case they are expressed in terms of number minus number (10 - 1) <a href="#footnote-body.1" name="footnote-link.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>.� Note that only one alteration symbol is allowed, so 8 cannot be represented by "IIX". The following is an example of using symbols out of order:</p>
<p>��������� * CM = (100)(1000) = 1000-100 = 900</p>
<p>In this way, all numbers can be reproduced (to a point).� Here are some examples:</p>
<p>��������� 1) 1997 = MCMXCVII = 1000+(1000-100)+(100-10)+5+1+1 = ������������ 1000+900+90+7.<br>
��������� 2) 1066 = MLXVI = 1000+50+10+5+1.<br>
��������� 3) 414 = CDXIV = (500-100)+10+(5-1) = 400+10+4.</p>
<p>There is no symbol for zero.</p>
