<p>A species becomes extinct when its last representative dies. This has happened quite a lot of times on Earth, due, in many cases, to colonization and hunting by humans. A lot of humans feel that extinction is very sad, and try to protect life-forms on the brink of extinction by naming them "endangered species" and being nice to them.</p>
<p>One of the most well known examples is, in fact, a whole group of extinct species known as the dinosaurs (terrible lizards). Since these creatures became extinct about sixty-three million Earth years before homo-sapiens evolved from apes, and about sixty-five million Earth years before they started becoming interested in what effect their actions were having on the other life on the planet, the reasons for their demise have remained a mystery.</p>
<p>Some other more recent extinctions include the woolly mammoth, the great lemur of Madagascar, and the dodo. See cross-references for enlightenment on these and other subjects.</p>
