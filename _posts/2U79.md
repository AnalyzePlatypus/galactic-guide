<p>The present hype of random dot stereograms and random dot stereo movies has induced another invention. After some months of research it is now possible to produce a signal that, when played on a radio with just one speaker, first sounds like the noise you get in between channels but when you focus your ears on infinity lets you hear sounds in stereo.</p>
<p>So far only one broadcasting company has started broadcasting programs with help of this wholly remarkable technique. They are the same dudes who aired the TV channel that brings the images of goldfish in an aquarium to your home 24 hours a day. They have now begun to transmit a radio signal that, when played on a mono speaker radio set, allows you to hear, in stereo, the sea!</p>
