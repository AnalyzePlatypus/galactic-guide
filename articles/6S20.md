footnotes: {"[1]":"Editor's Note:\nPersonally I think it is because pretzels are non-alcoholic and slightly salty. The salt makes you more thirsty so you buy more beer. The pretzels are useful for soaking up beer in the stomach and thus you are able to drink more. Do not drink on an empty stomach! There isn't really any kind of conspiracy of pretzel like aliens invading planet Earth [2].","[2]":"Author's Note:\nWell you would say that wouldn't you."}

<p>Something has been intriguing my intellect for the last few hours. The thing about people with Beer and Pretzels. Whenever someone tells a story with people that happen to be in a bar, there is a pretzel bowl. Whenever someone drinks a beer, the usual snack item with them are pretzels. What is wrong with people?</p>
<p>Bertenders have claimed that the contrast between dry pretzel and wet beer is good for business. People say that same contrast really tastes good. Some people think that its just the fact that pretzels and beer happen to be close to the same shade of brown, and thats good enough reason for them.</p>
<p>Me? I think that pretzles are really some kind of spy device. The beings that brought them here are microscopic, and they have brainwashed the bartenders into serving pretzles. Upon digestion, they take readings of your internal systems. Then they record this data, so they can reproduce and finally take over this measly planet Earth. <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a></p>
<p>So remember, if you've ever eaten a pretzel, they know about you, and you are on their list.</p>
