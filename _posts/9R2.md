<p>The Unfortunate Life of David Kilbourne is a very funny book written by a surprisingly clever Earthman named Mike Rohde <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>. It is a book about the journey of a man, his ex-wife, and a talking Chihuahua, as they attempt to return to Earth after they are abducted by a super-intelligent race of plaid cloth known as the Patchers. Total nonsense, you say? You're right, but what do you want to read? Another of Earth's wordy courtroom books? Or one-thousand pages dedicated to some Navy guys stuck in a submarine?</p>
<p>Anyway, check it out at: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130205231804/http://members.gnn.com/MRohde6592/davidk.htm">http://members.gnn.com/MRohde6592/davidk.htm</a></p>
<p>Currently, only excerpts from his book can be viewed at the above site, but he will soon be posting up a few chapters of his book at a time. Unless, of course, he develops amnesia from a freak boating accident, in which case he says he will try really hard to remember to post them.</p>
