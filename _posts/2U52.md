<p>It has often been said that drinking is like sex - fun to do, sinful, and (on the planet Quartelhoose) illegal after 11:00pm on weekdays. One way in which they differ, however, is that there is no natural alcoholic equivalent of the multiple orgasm.</p>
<p>This was a problem which for many centuries vexed large numbers of scientists, driving a few of them to drink, but mostly driving them away from drink and towards sex, which they finally decided was more fun. Then one day, a young Alpha Centauran economics student (who should never have been in the laboratory in the first place, but, being an economics student, didn't have any lectures to go to) found himself reasoning thus: "If I don't know how to do something, and I am a character in a pastiche of the <em>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em>, then Douglas Adams himself should be able to cop out of this if he was here. Since he isn't here, all I have to do is rip off a well known passage from the Guide (such as, for example, the bit about the Infinite Improbability Drive), plug it into a really hot rehash of jokes from old Footlights reviews, and stand well back."</p>
<p>This he did, and nobody was at all surprised when an Alpha Centaurian Alcohol Enhancing Device popped out of this comedy with no real attempt at any logical explanation of its creation or existence whatsoever. <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
