<p>Pamplona, is a sleepy and quiet little Spanish town. It is about an hours drive from San Sebastian, and the North East coast of Spain. The road through the mountains to get there can be quite treacherous <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>, but once there, the picturesque views, cobbled streets, and quiet and relaxed way of life are most enchanting.</p>
<p>It is also very amusing to see the occasional uninformed tourist wandering around and saying "where are the bulls, where are the bulls?".</p>
<p>All of this is applicable only outside of the first two weeks of July, for it is at this time that the Renowned Festival of San Fermin takes place. This sleepy town is transformed overnight into a non-stop, raging, drunken party! The streets are packed with people 24 hours per day, mostly wearing white <a href="#footnotes.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a> with red bandannas, stumbling along, singing, drinking Sangria, and having <em>FUN</em>.</p>
