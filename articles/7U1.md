<p>White Aryan resistance is the amount of resistance that a white Aryan displays when a current is passed through his or her body. This is usually measured in Ohms, as it is with standard resistors. Since each white Aryan has a different resistance potential, it is advisable to start a program to identify white Aryans and test their resistance potential with high voltage low amp cables and an Ohmmeter.</p>
<p>Each white Aryan will then be painted with a series of color bars, indicating their resistance capability, as with standard resistors. This color bar code should be displayed prominently on the forehead to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>A detailed analysis of white Aryan resistance values will soon be released. The data gathered thus far will accompany a proposal for "White power plants" to be opened as soon as possible. <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
