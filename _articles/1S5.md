<div>
<p>No matter how many people tell you to go to Hell, don't. At no place in the space time continuum is it a pleasant place: It was lousy since it opened and there are no plans for improvement.</p>
<p>The actual description of the place varies from religion to religion and planet to planet, and is based mostly on hearsay. The one thing they agree uniformly is that it's set up to make you unhappy and is thus a place to avoid.</p>
<p>If you still feel compelled by the amazing number of people who tell you to go there, remember that people are not always concerned with what's in your best interest. Also, analyze your behavior for elements which could be misconstrued as aggravating.</p>
