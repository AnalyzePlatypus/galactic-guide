<p>When travelling on the planet Dennom be careful where you tread. Local volcanic land formations contain peizo-electric substances. On putting pressure on these cones you will be given an electric shock - the strength dependant on the size of the cone and how many McDog's polystyrene burger cartons you have eaten (i.e., your weight).</p>
<p>Fortunately for the planet's tourist industry, this does have its benefits. A web of high quality electrical cable covers the planet - which drives the largest natural loud speaker system in the known universe.</p>
