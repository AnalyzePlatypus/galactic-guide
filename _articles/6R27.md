<p>The Festival of San Fermin takes place during the first two weeks of July, in the sleepy <a href="#footnote-body.1" name="footnote-link.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a> Spanish town of Pamplona. Before you can contemplate anything as mind-bogglingly stupid as "Running with the Bulls," you have to get there. You have to get there at the right time as well, making things even more complicated for your average hitchhiker, but if you can't manage this small piece of organization, then you probably wouldn't survive anyway.</p>
<p>Once you are there, the fun starts. It doesn't matter what time of day or night you arrive, this place is <em>permanently</em> jumping! As you arrive in town, stick to the right, and try to park next to the grass, overlooking the big drop to the river - a good sleeping zone. <a href="#footnote-body.2" name="footnote-link.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a></p>
<p>Then head out into town. Try the Sangria, available 24 hours a day at many a corner shop. Head into any of the spit'n'sawdust bars <a href="#footnote-body.3" name="footnote-link.3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a> for a beer. Dance and party!</p>
<p>Of course, drinking and partying are not the only things to do. Unfortunately, I can't tell you much about the other things, because drinking and partying are all _I_ wanted to do.</p>
<p>Recommended entertainments:</p>
<pre>
 - Running with the Bulls <a href="#footnote-body.6" name="footnote-link.6" class="footnote-link">[6]</a>
 - Fountain Diving <a href="#footnote-body.6" name="footnote-link.6" class="footnote-link">[6]</a>
 - Bull taunting <a href="#footnote-body.4" name="footnote-link.4" class="footnote-link">[4]</a>
 - Bull "fighting" <a href="#footnote-body.5" name="footnote-link.5" class="footnote-link">[5]</a>
 - Drinking and Partying
</pre>
<p>I assume that you know about the last one. If not, then this is probably not the festival for you.</p>
