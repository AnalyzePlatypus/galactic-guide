<div>
<p>The planet Humphrey was found from the deviation in the orbits of Neptune and Uranus that could not be accounted to Pluto. It is made of an unknown dark matter that doesn't reflect in the optical or infrared. It is four times heavier than the Earth and has a strongly inclined, stretched out orbit around the Sun. Its year is approximately 800 Earth years.</p>
<p>A lot of hoopy froods used to live here, but now Humphrey's completely deserted because everyone reached such a level of coolness that they've all gone to the Solar System Ultra-Party on the Sun.</p>
