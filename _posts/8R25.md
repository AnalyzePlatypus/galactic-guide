<p>What the world currently lacks in security, it makes up with a healthy, or perhaps an unhealthy degree of stupidity. The problems of theft and vandalism have, for many years, caused much panic and distress throughout the population, as more and more crimes of this nature have been committed.</p>
<p>To fight the specific area of car theft and vandalism, science gave us the car alarm. Unfortunately, it totally failed to perfect it, even in a small way, before the market capitalised on the demand and gave the public what they believed they wanted.</p>
<p>The major flaw in car alarms, as they stand, is that nobody has the faintest idea how they should be adjusted, and so many car alarms are too sensitive, and are triggered by so much as a mouse sneezing 200 metres away. The rest can withstand a major earthquake without even a single beep.</p>
<p>It is because of this, that when anybody actually hears a car alarm sounding, their first thoughts are not, "Quick, quick, somebody's car is being broken into!", but rather, "When is someone going to shut up that bloody car alarm?"</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a car alarm is recognised as a good way to protect your car, at least in part, as a car thief is generally recognised to steer clear of loud noises in the course of his or her duty, on the grounds that it might marginally increase the likelihood of detection. <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
