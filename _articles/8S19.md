<p>Have you ever seen the sunset reflect its reddish rays in the Roxen <a href="#footnote-body.1" name="footnote-link.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a> sea? Have you ever traveled along the Staangaa <a href="#footnote-body.2" name="footnote-link.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a> listening to the birds singing? Have you ever walked the streets of Ryd <a href="#footnote-body.3" name="footnote-link.3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a> late at night watching students try to find their way home? If you have, you've probably already seen what's to see in Linkoeping, and know your way around. But if you haven't, let me tell you about this sweet little city.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of people here, but the ones you should be looking for are the students <a href="#footnote-body.4" name="footnote-link.4" class="footnote-link">[4]</a> and the ex-students <a href="#footnote-body.5" name="footnote-link.5" class="footnote-link">[5]</a>. These people know how to enjoy life, if you don't disturb them in some really important project or exam. If you have a towel (which I assume everyone has) you can crash at any place. There are a lot of great hotels (if you travel with a huge expense account) that I can really recommend, but for the average hiker there are more inexpensive ways of crashing, like dorm rooms, other hikers' apartments, nice little forests, and of course the gutter. :-)</p>
<p>The people of Linkoeping are quite friendly. I've only lived here for a couple of months but I really feel welcome.</p>
<p>There is nowhere in this town where you can get a nice pint of Guinness, but they do have some other nice brands of intergalactic beer. If you dare, you might want to visit the Systembolag <a href="#footnote-body.6" name="footnote-link.6" class="footnote-link">[6]</a> where you can buy cans of Guinness, but you have to drink it elsewhere.</p>
<p>The hiker culture is widely spread in Linkoeping. Most people in the "students/ex-students" category know about the Guide, and the answer to the big question of "life, universe and everything" is known by each and every one of them (although the opinion about the correct answer may vary a bit).</p>
<p>If your spacecraft should happen to drop you off in Linkoeping, give me a call on the URG <a href="#footnote-body.7" name="footnote-link.7" class="footnote-link">[7]</a> and I'll be happy to show you around.</p>
<p>So what happened to the "Why? When? How?"?</p>
<ul>
<li>Why? Easily answered. It's a nice place!</li>
<li>When? Summertime is preferred, but you will always find nice people here.</li>
<li>How? Just bring your towel and the rest will be an easy ride.</li>
</ul>
