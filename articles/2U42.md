<p>If I'm not mistaken, the process of devilling ham begins with the drawing of a pentagram. Several women who were known in their previous lives to have ridden broomsticks in to work then begin incantations and dances around the pentagram. The ham sits inside the pentagram, where the Devil is hopefully going to appear.</p>
<p>After chanting several prayers backwards, and beseeching Beelzebub to appear, the women are joined by men who have pointed tails and horns. They appear from someplace as yet unknown, bearing bottles of spices and grinders. These are placed inside the pentagram with the appropriate reverence and with the chanting of "Satan! Satan!"</p>
<p>If the chants are all done with total conviction, and all present truly believe, the supplicated being, Satan, will appear in the pentagram, and, in a flash of blinding light, grind the ham, mix in the spices, and leave everything in a sealed can with a pop-up top. He leaves a small portrait of himself on the wrapper which is supposed to go around the can.</p>
<p>Voila! Devilled ham.</p>
<p>Now, for devils food cake..... definitely a sacrifice of some kind is necessary. <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
