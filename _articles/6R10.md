<p>Here is how to catch crayfish, without the expense of buying boats and obtaining licenses:</p>
<pre>
Requirements: A boat.
              Somebody to own and drive aforementioned boat.
              A way of being awake at four o'clock in the morning <a href="#footnote-body.1" name="footnote-link.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>.
              A little populated but productive crayfishing area.
</pre>
<p>Procedures: Get the boat owner drunk enough so that he will be reckless and devil-may-care, but not so drunk that he will sink the boat on the first available reef. Simply drive around in the boat, pulling up all the cray pots that you can find, and emptying them of all crayfish, irrespective of size, colour or sex.</p>
<p>Pitfalls: While the above procedures are not illegal<a href="#footnote-body.2" name="footnote-link.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a>, getting caught doing them IS. A certain fat police sergeant had been condemned to life <a href="#footnote-body.3" name="footnote-link.3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a> for the heinous crime of being caught doing this.</p>
<p>It is also a terribly bad idea to head down to the local Cray-fisherman's bar in the evening, and start off in a loud voice "Hey, guess what _I_ did this morning!"</p>
