<p>The best thing to do with your carpet weave is to ignore it. Under <em>no</em> circumstances should you ever, ever, ever try to get your carpet weave to all go the same direction. On ninety-five percent of all carpets in existence, this is impossible; the remaining five percent have an odd attraction about them that makes someone invariably walk on them just when you've finished. If you value your mental health at all, please, just ignore the damned weave.</p>
