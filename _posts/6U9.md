<p>Nowadays, when someone finishes a task or when someone explains something, quite often you can hear them say "Walla!!" at the end. Few people still know what exactly it means. The explanation is actually quite simple.</p>
<p>A walla is an animal, a relative of the kangaroo. When scientists first discovered the walla, they decided for some unknown reason to categorize them by letters. The walla-B is a very cute species of walla found in Australia. The walla-Q is rather smaller and more rabbit like, and it has a tendency to hide in black stove-pipe hats. Back in the days when people wore such hats, most people couldn't distinguish between the various wallas, so when they found a walla-Q in a hat, they would just shout "Walla!" and get rid of the little bugger as fast as possible.</p>
