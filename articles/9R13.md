<p>If your hearing starts to get worse, all you really need is for people to speak up a little. There is a very simple and cheap way to do this. There is no need yet to buy an expensive hearing aid, which has the unpleasant side effect of increasing the background noise to the same level of the sound you want to hear.</p>
<p>The fact is, that if people see someone wearing a hearing aid, they will automatically speak up (although it is, of course, not necessary anymore). So the only thing you need to do, is to attach a piece of electric wire to your ear, and connect it to some kind of flesh coloured knob. One of those personal stereo earplugs will do fine too.</p>
<p>This trick doesn't work too well when standing near a president.</p>
