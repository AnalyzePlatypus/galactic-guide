footnotes: {"[1]":"An actual incident of this occured in the early 1980s. A woman had been planting seeds in her garden, using the fishing rod of a garden gnome to poke holes in the soil for the seeds. Several days later she walked past the gnome, scraped her leg on the rod and shortly died of lockjaw."}

<p>Anyone who has fallen victim to a vicious garden gnome armed with a rusty fishing rod <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>, or has dressed as a troll and leapt into a murky river and sliced their leg open will know the annoyance that is the Tetanus Injection.</p>
<p>Originally touted as a preventive jab against infection, the Tetanus Injection (literally: needle-up-the-bum) now forms an integral part of health education. In these modern times, I'm certain that the contents of this injection could be formulated into a pill or ointment, but still the medical profession administer it in its most painful format. Hence my theory that this is done to dissuade one from repeating the action that precipitated the requirement for the injection.</p>
<p>The injection acts as a Pavlovian Stick, with the hope that the feeble mind will associate the pain and humiliation of a needle in the backside with whatever deed of stupidity was the cause of the injury. While this theory is refuted by doctors, it is however a plausible notion.</p>
