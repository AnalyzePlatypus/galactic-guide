<p>So you are visiting London and looking for a fun time? The best way to get around London is on foot with a Travelcard for getting onto buses and underground trains. At some point however you will need to cross a road.</p>
<p>High Street Kensington is a Mecca for fashionable shops and if you go there check out my favourite pedestrian crossing. It is at the North East end. In the UK you press a button at about stomach height on the traffic light and a sign saying "wait" lights up. I mean, why? If you are bothered enough to press a button to change the lights then you are probably aren't going to jump out in front of a car. A few seconds later the traffic lights change to red, and a green walking man lights up. You don't get the "Walk" / "Don't Walk" signs in the UK. To aid blind and partially sighted people there is usually a beeping sound signifying that it is safe to cross (assuming that the traffic stops at the red light).</p>
<p>The reason why this is my favourite pedestrian crossing is that the beeping sound is almost exactly the same as the sound effects in the original Space Invaders arcade game. Try it and see. <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
