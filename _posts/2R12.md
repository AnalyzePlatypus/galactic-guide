<p>Any hitch-hiker who visits bars a lot can tell you that, in whatever galaxy the bar is located, the problems one encounters when visiting one (or more precisely, after one has visited one for quite some time) are roughly the same all over the universe.</p>
<p>This article is meant to give some common solutions to these problems, which can be quite useful for the unexperienced hitch-hiker...</p>
