<p>Alcohol, as has already been noted, has an intoxicating effect on certain carbon-based lifeforms. Guilt also has an effect but this is a detoxicating effect and this occurs mainly with students with their fundamental concerns with money, and goes something like this:</p>
<pre>
AFTER ONE PINT    - "oh God, that could have been a pound of mince"
AFTER TWO PINTS   - "God, that could have been two ring binders"
AFTER THREE PINTS - "God, that could have been thirty biros"
AFTER FOUR PINTS  - "God, that could have been a pascal manual"
</pre>
<blockquote>...and so on ad infinitum</blockquote>
<p>So as the alcohol intake goes up, the guilt therefore goes up. Eventually the two equalize at a point around six to eight pints therefore students cannot get drunk!</p>
<p>(Note: Students are found drunk quite often; this is due to guilt-reducing drugs, such as large quantities of alcohol.) <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
