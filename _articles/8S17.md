<p>Chocolate milk is a great multi-purpose drink, with many forms and uses. There are mainly two kinds of chocolate milk:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">chocolate syrup <a href="#footnote-body.1" name="footnote-link.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>, mixed on the spot with milk, and</li>
<li value="2">chocolate and milk premixed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first kind is most useful to hitchhikers. Chocolate syrup has a long shelf life, is cheap, and can easily be carried, waiting for the moment the hitchhiker has access to a cow. Also, the syrup can be drank by itself for a quick burst of energy. This is not advised, however, because in tests it was shown to cause a subject's eyes to explode.</p>
<p>The standard ratio of syrup to milk is 1 1/2 tablespoons to 8 ounces. It does not taste as good as the second kind, but when one is hitchhiking that is usually the least of one's concerns.</p>
<p>The second kind requires no work and tastes better, but it must be refrigerated, and costs more.</p>
<p>Chocolate milk, in general, has many uses. It can be heated to keep you warm, or cooled to cool you down. The syrup can be put on foods such as waffles, ice cream, etc. It can also be used as a universal lubricant. It costs little and tastes good. On the hitchhiker's scale of 1-21, 21 being the highest, I give it a 17.</p>
