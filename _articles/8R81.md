<p>Many people all over the world suspect that the truth about the UFO which crashed in Roswell, USA in 1947, is kept secret from the general public by the CIA, the FBI, the American defence ministry, and many other authorities. In Russia, however, things are handled differently. Something truly mysterious is even advertised by the Russian authorities: just 90 km from Moscow, there exists a genuine loop in space. Hardly anyone knows about it, because nobody seems to care to come and see.</p>
<p>Take Yaroslavskoe shosse, which goes North-East from Moscow, and drive some 90 kilometres until you see the sign "Alexandrov --&gt;". Next to it there is another sign, saying "Alexandrov -- 22 km".</p>
<p>Now, when you pass the signs, turn to the right and take the road to Alexandrov. If you continue on this road for 200 metres, you will see a sign saying "Alexandrov -- 27 km".</p>
<p>So while you thought you drove (or walked, it makes no difference) these 200 metres forward, you were, in fact, moving backwards in the space loop, at a very high speed (25 times the apparent speed of forward movement). Notice: the local authorities even put <em>signs</em> up to indicate the space loop.</p>
<p>You do not believe me? Please come and see for yourself!</p>
