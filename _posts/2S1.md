<p>It's not surprising that people in this forum are confused about infinity.</p>
<p>It's hard to reconcile infinity so most of us don't even try. We just marvel for a while, then wander off find a party so we don't have to think about it. After a few Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters, the incipient panic goes away, and we really start to enjoy ourselves.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the problem of understanding infinity gets left to people with absolutely no social skills, so even if they did show up at the party (unlikely, since who'd invite them?) and even if they did try to explain it (likely, since, as I said, they have absolutely no social skills and are completely oblivious to the fact that you're really trying to be alone with that fabulous being in the kitchen and don't give a pair of fetid dingo's kidneys what they have to say) you wouldn't learn anything because that fabulous being would start talking to someone else and you'd turn on your tormenter and say "Yeah, we figured that out last week and it's going to be published in a really keen journal so eat your heart out" and stomp off to the bar without having heard a word they said.</p>
<p>So have some sympathy for these poor benighted people who don't understand infinity. They've got terrible hangovers and didn't get laid.</p>
