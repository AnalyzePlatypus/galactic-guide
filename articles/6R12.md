<div>
<p>The now classic Gate Crasher's Entrance is a useful way to get into a party without knowing anyone, but without those whom you don't know knowing that.</p>
<pre>
Pre-requisites: Some sort of (unopened) alcoholic beverage <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>.
                Nonchalance.
</pre>
<p>Procedure: Simple. Just stroll into the room as if you know at least half the people, making greeting gestures to occasional chairs, lamps and doors. This is always a good bet, because usually half the people don't know the other half, and assume that this is the half that you know. The other half act likewise.</p>
<p>Pitfalls: Don't try this when there are less than four people<br>
at the party.</p>
