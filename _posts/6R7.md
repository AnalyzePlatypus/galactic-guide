<p>The term <em>Encyclopedia Galactica</em> has been used by many writers, when they have needed references to some type of official encyclopedia in their works. Probably the first one to use the term was Isaac Asimov. Asimov used the term <em>Encyclopedia Galactica</em> in his Foundation trilogy, which was first published as eight novels between 1942 and 1949. In all the Foundation books by Asimov, the last one written in 1993, there are references to the <em>Encyclopedia Galactica</em>. Douglas Adams has also used the term <em>Encyclopedia Galactica</em> in his Hitch-Hiker's Guide trilogy. Adams only goes so far as to compare <em>Encyclopedia Galactica</em> to the <em>Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em>, which by comparison is a bit cheaper.</p>
<p>The Project Galactic Guide (PGG) can maybe be seen as an attempt to bring a reasonably accurate encyclopedia to the people of the universe. But nevertheless must the <em>Encyclopedia Galactica</em> be considered the ultimate reference book in the future. <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
