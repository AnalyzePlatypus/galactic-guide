<p>Tony Roma's -- a good place for ribs. There are some places in the galaxy where there are no good non-corporation owned barbecue places... but there is a Tony Roma's. The question is, then, how is Tony Roma's?</p>
<p>Expensive for the everyday meal, but every once in a while -- it's nice. Always go to the more crowded ones; they have better food. The reason being that the more people who eat there, the faster the food is replaced and the better their ribs are.</p>
<p>Of the side dishes, EAT THE CORN ON THE COB!!! From what the waitress told me one time, it is a special variety of corn (the type I can't remember), and it is going to be about the best corn on the cob you will ever eat out.</p>
<p>The ribs are good. The best deal is when they have the sampler platter (I'm drooling as I write). You get a taste of every type of rib that they have (yes, they have more than one kind). The Carolina Honeys are particularly good.</p>
<p>Be careful in what you select! A dinner for two can run upwards of $40 if you are not careful in what you choose. So, choose, but choose wisely. If you don't like ribs, they have chicken and fish and shrimp, all of which are very good. Especially the shrimp.</p>
<p>Yum!</p>
<p>(If you don't like ribs, see "Pizza".)</p>
