<p>The steps to getting on the America's Cup Bandwagon:</p>
<pre>
Requirements: - A home town with a port, preferably with lots of charm
                and character.
              _ Lots of spare cash <a href="#footnotes.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a>.
              - Lots of friends in the local government <a href="#footnotes.3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a>.
</pre>
<pre>
Procedure: - Find someone from your local town who can win the
             America's Cup.
           - When he wins, get your Prime Minister to say something like
             "Anyone who sacks someone for not turning up to work tomorrow
              is a mug".
           - Buy lots of real-estate near the port, preferably including
             several pubs with lots of charm and character <a href="#footnotes.4" class="footnote-link">[4]</a>.
           - Remove any traces of charm and character, by gutting
             the buildings, and filling them full of polished wood
             floors, brass bar rails, and "quaint" yachting paraphernalia.
           - Buy a brewery and name it after you <a href="#footnotes.5" class="footnote-link">[5]</a>.
           - That's it, you're on the Bandwagon!
</pre>
<pre>
Pit-falls: - Be careful of <a href="#footnotes.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a> and <a href="#footnotes.3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a>, or you could wind up
             as a Siberian scrap-metal merchant.
</pre>
<p>Alternatives: Hitchhikers with less ambition can simply make cheap and tacky souvenirs with a yachty theme, and flog them<br>
to American and Japanese tourists. Although a little lower profile, it doesn't matter, you'll still be on the bandwagon.</p>
