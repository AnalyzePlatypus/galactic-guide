<p>Now, every hoopy hitchhiker knows the value of their towel. However, for you newby and not-so-hoopy travellers just starting out, the acquisition of that perfect towel is a puzzle. How can you know which towel is right for you?</p>
<p>Well the first criteria is available funds. A top-of-the-line towel can set the newby back mega-bucks. Features include:</p>
<blockquote>o protein-impregnated colour bands in fifteen flavours o woven in heat resistant, warmth conserving materials o decals of prestigious towel fashion house Klein Dior o tailored to personal design<br>
o extra fluffiness</blockquote>
<p>If your top-of-the-line towel does not include at least these features then you have been ripped-off most unhoopily.</p>
<p>Most newbies, however, simply do not have these sort of funds (otherwise, why would they be hitchhiking?). In these cases, a simpler design is recommended.</p>
<p>Many new hitchhikers consider the second-hand towel market. This does have the advantage of giving the hitchhiker the air of one well-travelled. But not knowing where your towel has been can be most unhoopy, so be sure to get a record of previous travel from the previous owner or the dealer. <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
