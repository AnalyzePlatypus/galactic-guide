<p>Country music (sometimes called "Country Western," though that's basically redundant but those who listen to it usually don't care about redundancy, or care about it, either) is hard to characterize. Unless you like it, you hate it intensely. If you like it, you probably hate everything else intensely. While several country music groups have tried to slide their style into a more acceptable niche, they've only met with limited success.</p>
<p>If you see people playing music, you can probably calculate that they are playing country music if you sense an inordinate number of cowboy boots, cowboy hats, women with chunky thighs, sequins, tassels, and fringe. The elderly also seems to be a prevalent subsection of the audience for country music.</p>
<p>If you take pride in your ability to be sensical, sane, and generally happy, you have been warned to stay away from country music.</p>
