<p>Jelly Babies are a sweet jelly-like confection. They are shaped to resemble babies, hence the name. In each packet, you will find many different flavours, at least one of which you will dislike, and so will all your friends.</p>
<p>Jelly Babies have been popularised with some, by their appearance in a British science-fiction series called Doctor Who, in which the main character was known to offer these to various people during the course of his adventures.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that it is fairly difficult to do, it is almost impossible to eat a Jelly Baby without biting the head off first. <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
