<p>There is a small coffee house, by the name of Ciao in the town of Clinton Township, MI. This is one of the best places to go if you are a hitchhiker in dire need of that life-giving drug <em>caffeine</em> <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>. Ciao is located at 17 1/2 mile <a href="#footnotes.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a> and Garfield road.</p>
<p>The man who owns Ciao is Fat Sal <a href="#footnotes.3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a><a href="#footnotes.4" class="footnote-link">[4]</a>. The people there (i.e. Sal) are very fluent in Italian. And frequently have annoying Italian music playing, and, even more frequently, annoying Italian movies. Also, do not be surprised if they speak to each other in, yes, you guessed it, Italian.</p>
<p>And, yes, they do have a killer cup of cappucino. For maximum effect, go two doors down in the mini-mall to Bernie's Party Store and buy a big bottle of Jolt. This will keep you up for longer than you think, and enable you to search for more rides.</p>
