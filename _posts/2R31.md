<p>The ability to rationalize is an invaluable skill for today's hitchhiker, second only to the art of bluffing. The proper use of this skill enables the hitchhiker to accomplish all sorts of amazing feats, one of the most wondrous of these being the ability to get out of doing any physical or mental labor that might be required. This is done simply by convincing oneself that you have done enough work and a good rest is in order. Unfortunately, to completely avoid the pangs of conscience that will undoubtedly accompany such a decision, one must be truly adept at the art of rationalization. This much sought-after degree of mastery takes many years of practice. The only good side to this is the fact that you are practicing your rationalization techniques is a great excuse for getting out of work.</p>
<p>Another good use for rationalization is to convince yourself that the guy you just stole that car from didn't really need it as much as you do (I mean, <em>he</em> doesn't have to get out of town because of that bank job you just pulled) and besides, you're not really stealing it, just borrowing it without his knowing, which really isn't the same thing.... As you can see, there is a lot of money to be made in philosophy.</p>
