<p>Falling somewhere between those periods that have come to be known as "morning" and "afternoon", the deep, dark temporal void that we know as "lunchtime" falls.</p>
<p>Serving not only as a handy, fun-size marker to indicate whether the day is on an upward struggle, or a downhill slide, lunchtime allows us to partake of vital nutritional nourishment.</p>
<p>That is, of course, assuming that your canteen isn't due to close in a period not in excess of five minutes. This is perhaps the overring factor contributing to the conciseness of this article.</p>
