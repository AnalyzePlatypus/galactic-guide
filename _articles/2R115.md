<p>Oh well, here's another Computer Science student trying to build up his ego with another self-describing article.</p>
<p>I was born, as most people are, only for me it was rather difficult, and they had to suck me out with something very much like those things you use for cleaning a sink, and I were even fourteen days overdue.</p>
<p>Actually, that tells a lot about me. I do all things reluctantly and preferably at LEAST fourteen days late... at that I consider myself a little like my great idol: Douglas Noel Adams.</p>
<p>I spend humongous amounts of time roaming the InterNet (especially the World Wide Web), and I play a lot of games on my newly bought 486DX2-66. Heck, if you shouldn't be able to play computer games on it, why buy it? X-Wing on an XT <strong>is</strong> a drag, not to say impossible.</p>
<p>I also read too many comic books.</p>
<p>While we're at it, I even wear glasses, and my nose is too big, therefore I'll end this article with a personified Smiley: 8*)</p>
<p>Oh, and while we're at it, my personal Geek Code is:</p>
<p>GCS -d+ p+ c++(++++) l u++(+++) e*(+) m+ s+/++ n-(---) h+() f(?) g+ w++(+++) t r !y</p>
