<p>Passports are a vital form of documented evidence used to prove your identity at border crossings, or in any case from one country to another, and in other occasional circumstances when visual identification is necessary. This is mostly true.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is that most photographs on passports look nothing like their owner. Indeed it is deemed to be the height of suspicion if you look anything like your passport photograph unless it is very new <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>. If the picture is too dissimilar, it may be necessary to gain a replacement.</p>
<p>Passports are generally stamped upon entry to another country though this is not necessarily compulsory. A regular international traveller can expect to fill his or her passport in a short time, and may need to obtain a replacement before it would normally expire.</p>
<p>In recent years a standard European passport has begun to be issued to all residents of the European Union countries. It is still the case, however, that countries, the United Kingdom at the very least, still retain some form of crest or badge on the front.</p>
