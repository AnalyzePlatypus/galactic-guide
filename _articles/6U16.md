<div>
<p>This law was passed after a referendum many years ago, when many people got fed up of their property floating around all over the place. A grand committee was set up which recommended the introduction of a primitive system of gravitational forces to be gradually introduced into "test" sectors of the universe.</p>
<p>The committee voted by an overwhelming majority that these gravitational franchises should be run by separate universal corporations, who would institute charges (the gravity tax), in order to maintain the service profitably.</p>
<p>These franchises were bought by three main companies: the Universal Gravitational Corporation (UGC), the Corporeal Reactive Attraction Partnership (CRAP), GravityWatch, and SPIN. The latter of these two were eventually bought out by the South West Water Board, after they realised that without the advantage of gravitational attraction, they would quickly go out of business.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all something we take for granted. The former franchises have now amalgamated into the Gravity Organisational Department (GOD), who then embarked on a massive operation of acquiring many of the other privatised natural resources, and forming a virtual monopoly.</p>
