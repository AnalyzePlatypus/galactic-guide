footnotes: {"[1]":"The possibility exists that one announcer somewhere has realised the problem, and simply recites yesterday's weather forecast, intermixed with the football results.","[2]":"The number of speakers is irrelevant, but the disfunction is generally compulsory, and each speaker should be adjusted to allow the sound-waves to rebound off each wall unpredictably.","[3]":"There is an art to this, but sometimes it's necessary to pick them from a dictionary at random."}

<p>In a society where information is everything, and most of the population have yet to acquire the appropriate systems for obtaining instant specific information at the relevant times, a necessary creation has, for a long time, provided a theoretical solution. Unfortunately, its practicalities end when the theory is substituted with the reality, and you are stuck at a railway station with a PA system spewing incomprehensible gibberish into the locality.</p>
<p>In fact, the actual announcements, in most cases <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>, begin their lives as reasonably, or not-so-reasonably, constructed sentences, which then begin the journey through a microphone, and out into the world, via one small aged disfunctional speaker <a href="#footnotes.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a>. The results are, more often than not, a drunken echoed blur of noise that could equally mean the exact opposite of what was originally intended.</p>
<p>As a result of this, many people who were set to benefit from a public address system, will simply be as confused as ever, or perhaps more so, and could also become increasingly angry that they may be missing a vitally important announcement. Of course, if they managed to quieten all the other noises in the vicinity, they would still be unable to comprehend the announcement in question, so their position is just as helpless if the cries of "Keep the bloody noise down!" are sufficiently effective, or if, as is more frequently the case, they are just whispers in the wind.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is possible to extract the vaguest hint of a few words, which when threaded together and combined with a few other words of the interpreter's creation <a href="#footnotes.3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a>, construct an announcement that is almost certainly and almost totally unlike the one that it was intended to be.</p>
<p>While we are told that science is continually attempting to develop more and more sofisticated upgrades to these systems, it is too often the case that each solution is just as bad as the last one, and eventually, it is simpler to remain confused, and learn to live with it.</p>
