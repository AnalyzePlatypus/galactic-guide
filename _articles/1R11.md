<p>The Barenaked Ladies are, to put it succinctly, that is, to state the fact precisely, properly and pithily, or, to put it another way, in as few words as possible, in order to provide the reader with as much information in as short a space and small a time as possible, neither.</p>
<p>The 'Ladies are, in order of no particular, Steven Page, Ed Robertson, Andy Creeggan, Jim Creeggan, and Tyler Stewart. They are all from Scarborough, a suburb of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Earth.</p>
<p>With songs like "If I Had $1,000,000" <a href="#footnote-body.1" name="footnote-link.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a> and "Be My Yoko Ono" <a href="#footnote-body.2" name="footnote-link.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a>, the 'Ladies independent self-named cassette sold 100,000 copies in their home country. This gave them the most successful recording in Canadian, and (unbeknownst to the denizens of the backwater planet on which they reside) Galactic history.</p>
<p>Their most recent (and first commercial) album, Gordon, sold almost 200,000 copies in its first month of release. Their promotional tour has been met with great enthusiasm in Canada; however, success in the large country to the south has been limited. A concert in a parking lot on the West Coast was attended by a child holding a balloon, and a hot-dog vendor.</p>
