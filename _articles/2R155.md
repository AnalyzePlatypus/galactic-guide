<p>A short description of Rickard Andersson follows:</p>
<p>I have lived in Sweden since my birth 1968-10-05 and am still figuring out how to handle this Life thing. (A PGG article on the topic will be written when I get it all under control :-)</p>
<p>The towns that I have been staying in are in chronological order Norrkoeping, Umea, Gothenburg, Karlskrona, Umea and today Linkoeping.</p>
<p>I'm making a living by working for "SoftLab", a computer consultant company in the software industry. In my free time I'm fooling around with my Macintosh, making shareware programs and other (un)important stuff.</p>
<p>One of the programs I have made, is the PGG-Viewer for Macintosh computers. This is my contribution to the PGG people all around the universe.</p>
<p>My research for PGG articles is done by living a normal life and occasionally I scribble down a PGG article. After I get the article confirmation, I relax and continue to live.</p>
<p>If you want to get in touch with my towel, I will forward all messages from my e-mail address "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130117013941/mailto:rickard@softlab.se">rickard@softlab.se</a>". <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
