<p>Occasionally, when you are not dealing with lack of time, you are dealing with an excess of time. While rare, it can happen. So, enclosed below, are twenty-six ways to kill time.</p>
<p>*<strong>*WARNING</strong><strong>* Do NOT attempt to unplug an atomic clock! *</strong><strong>WARNING</strong>**</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Organize. It never hurts to prepare for dealing with the lack of time.</li>
<li value="2">Work. It never hurts to get money to spend for the next time time is plenty!</li>
<li value="3">Clean dryer lint filter. This may be why you have soggy towels.</li>
<li value="4">Buy postal stamps. Every time I need a stamp, I just thank myself for stocking up on them when I was killing time.</li>
<li value="5">Write a Guide article. New field reporters accepted daily!</li>
<li value="6">Stock up on weather forecasts. Instead of wasting a few hours looking for a weather forecast, why not stock up on them? They usually last for 3-5 days, if kept refrigerated.</li>
<li value="7">Wax your automobile, if you have one. Preventative maintenance.</li>
<li value="8">Clean your GuideNET Terminal. Preventative maintenance.</li>
<li value="9">Remove arachnid webs from dwelling. They are known to annoy even the most unsanitary hitchhiker.</li>
<li value="10">Grease your lunchbox hinges. Squeaky hinges ruin appetites.</li>
<li value="11">Clean your air conditioner filter, if you have one. Allergies go bye-bye.</li>
<li value="12">Spend a day pushing buttons in an elevator.</li>
<li value="13">Learn CPR. You never know when your ticker will tick out.</li>
<li value="14">Learn the Heimlich Maneuver. You never know when you'll bite your last bite.</li>
<li value="15">Learn First Aid. You never know when you'll get a fatal injury.</li>
<li value="16">Get a GuideNET Update. Preventative maintenance.</li>
<li value="17">Ride the bus. Also good for killing money.</li>
<li value="18">Give blood. H+ is in demand.</li>
<li value="19">Cuddle your cat. Cats have feelings, too.</li>
<li value="20">Shoot your clock. That will defiantly kill time.</li>
<li value="21">Empty your rain gauge. Mine accumulated 4,000 centimeters one time.</li>
<li value="22">Watch television. Educational programs spawn more and more time, though.</li>
<li value="23">Read a book. You could actually LEARN something.</li>
<li value="24">Dip into public baths. Look for signs that say "Swimming Pool". (Note: some hitchhikers should pay special attention to this suggestion.)</li>
<li value="25">Observe vehicles traverse by. Watch out for city lawn mowers.</li>
<li value="26">Organize your lint collection. 'nuff said.</li>
</ol>
