<p>Sometime around 20:00, on the 7th of June, 1965, a momentous event took place. At least, it was a momentous event in the life of Chris Tann: it started. Some 10829 standard Earth days later, he became a field reporter for Project Galactic Guide.</p>
<p>During these 10829 days, Chris achieved many things. He (re)started the "Manic Depressive Society," invented two completely different versions of the game "Boomshanka," and washed approximately 6000 <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a> socks <a href="#footnotes.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a>. He also spent quite some time as lead-singer of "Alistair in Wonderland."</p>
<p>He was described by The Scientologists as "A Compulsive Extrovert." They were most disappointed when, on replying to their offer of help, he was quoted as saying, "Hey man, what do I want help for, that's PERFECT!"</p>
