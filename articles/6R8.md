<div>
<p>This verbal expression can be heard in many situations. It is said by people who have found out that something isn't quite all right. It shows their feelings of having done something the wrong way or in the wrong place.</p>
<p>Well, maybe the best way to show you how to use the expression is with these small examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>When people finds out that they have done the wrong assignment for homework, they will sometime express their feeling with an <em>Aaargh</em>.</li>
<li>Picture yourself outside your house with all the keys to the door inside the house. Yes, an <em>Aaargh</em> is the right thing to say.</li>
<li>If you has programmed a very interesting piece of code, and then accidentally hits the wrong keys and erases everything, an <em>Aaargh</em> is perfectly accurate to scream.</li>
<li>When you have written an article and you can't seem to stop adding more or less useful explanations, the only thing to do is to end with an <em>Aaargh</em>.</li>
</ul>
