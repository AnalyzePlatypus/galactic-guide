<p>Emu Export Lager is a beer produced by the Swan Brewery, in Perth, Western Australia, Earth. It used to be the best beer in the world <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>. In fact, it used to be the ONLY beer in the world <a href="#footnotes.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a>, aside from Emu Bitter, which was only ever purchased by the people who buy a certain brand of beer simply because it was always the last beer to be stolen from the fridge at parties.</p>
<p>In the early days, it was produced in heavy, solid steel cans, making it perfect for playing "Beer Hunter". Unfortunately, a certain famous Australian businessman decided that the cans should be aluminium, firstly to appear more cosmopolitan, and secondly so we could fit more of it on the America's Cup Bandwagon. This ruined the game of Beer Hunter, but on the bright side, it meant that two cartons would come in just under one person's baggage allowance on international flights.</p>
<p>More recently, the chemists, botanists and psychologists of Swan Brewery have been playing with the recipe, trying to produce "an even more perfect beer" <a href="#footnotes.3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a>. This, quite predictably, failed dismally. They succeeded, however, in producing something that tasted like a cross between cat's piss and aluminium shavings, unexpectedly thrusting them into complete dominance of a brand new niche market <a href="#footnotes.4" class="footnote-link">[4]</a>.</p>
