<div>
<p>I have, through extensive experimentation, determined that air itself is homeopathic -- or, rather, that humidity alone is enough to cure all illness.</p>
<p>Following the general homeopathic principals of near-infinite dilution, I have reduced the water content of the subjects' air through the simple expedient of removing all their air supply. As my theory had predicted, all subjects soon ceased complaints of their illnesses!</p>
<p>As I, like many, wish to see an end to illness, I hereby renounce right of ownership of this new homeopathic technique, in the hopes that homeopathic practitioners the world over can make use of it without cost.</p>
