<p>Since last year's privatisation of Santa Claus, and the introduction of competition into the traditional Christmas presents service, a report has been produced by the government's Winter Seasonal Advisory Committee. The report recommends the following:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">A second Christmas be introduced in the middle of the year;</li>
<li value="2">Competition opened up to allow gas, electric, and water companies to tender bids for the remaining eight regional Santa monopolies, currently still controlled by the government;</li>
<li value="3">The separation of Santa Claus Plc <a href="#footnote-body.1" name="footnote-link.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a> and "The Grotto", allowing presents to be obtained from any, ie. the cheapest, manufacturer;</li>
<li value="4">Deregulation and reduced regulation of any remaining monopolies to remove "restrictive" cost impositions, including:
<ol>
<li value="1">The reduction of the value of presents-to-deliver from twenty per cent of income to five per cent of income; and</li>
<li value="2">The abolition of timing restraints that unnecessarily restricted delivery of presents to a few tight hours on the morning of the twenty-fifth; and</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li value="5">The removal of all that "fiddly" public accountability.</li>
</ol>
<p>The government is expected to accept the report, after in-depth discussion of the pros and cons, next week in a two minute meeting.</p>
