<div>
<p>Aardvark is traditionally the first word in any encyclopedia. By a strange coincidence it is designed to be the first entry at the top of the title list of Project Galactic Guide articles.</p>
<p>The first entry in the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction is for the American author "Abbey, Edward" who I have never heard of.</p>
<p>The first reference in the Oxford Reference Dictionary is "a".</p>
