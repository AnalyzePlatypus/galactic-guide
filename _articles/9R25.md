<div>
<p>Graceland is very frightening place that should be avoided at all costs. Everything there within a two-mile radius <a href="#footnote-body.1" name="footnote-link.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a> is devoted to Elvis. Going there is like stepping into an alternate world of glittery jumpsuits and bizarre memorabilia. If at all possible, avoid going there. If you can't avoid going there, then close your eyes and try not to let it bother you too much.</p>
