<p>Prou'Gress Ivro'K is the name of:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">A drink which affects you like the penii of a Knirglinbraianian Sex Gerilla (a Knirglinbraianian Sex Gerilla is a large, horned ape-like creature with two penii which are very big and covered with rough black bristles) invading your nostrils</li>
<li value="2">Un ugly music style invented by the Perverse Trisexual Limbo Dancer Killer Beasts from Shnarikon VIb which humanoid beings can only endure under the effect of Prou'Gress Ivro'K (1).</li>
</ol>
<p>This music style, which has some resemblance to a mixture of Earthian Techno, Sirian Doggy-Dogg, Vegan Tera-Grunge and the grunts of Knirglinbraianian Sex Gerillas, should not be mistaken for Progressive Rock - an entirely different music style which is played and listened to without consuming Prou'Gress Ivro'K (1) or other drugs.</p>
