<p>You are going home in a crowded bus. What can you do to break the rut? Here is the Top Ten list of fun things to do in a crowded bus.</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Pick a random person of the opposite sex. She/he should be almost completely out of range from your vision, so you can turn with absolutely no discretion and look at her/him one time or another <a href="#footnote-body.1" name="footnote-link.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>.</li>
<li value="2">Start making guttural sounds. Loudly.</li>
<li value="3">Talk to yourself. How your day was, how you got rid of your ingrown toenail, whatever.</li>
<li value="4">If you are carrying many things, start juggling them. Be it oranges, knives, pencils or fire extinguishers.</li>
<li value="5">If you are alone, start a sing-along. It is good social presence for you.</li>
<li value="6">Start a meaningless discussion about anything at all with the driver.</li>
<li value="7">Toss papers with the word "turn" written on both sides... to several people.</li>
<li value="8">Sell candy and make a very convincing `emergency-exit' speech, as it is done in airplanes. (No, I mean it!)</li>
<li value="9">Practise that last dance you've learned with your friends at work.</li>
<li value="10">Write stupid lists about anything at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Following these hints will surely make your everyday commuting much healthier and innovative.</p>
