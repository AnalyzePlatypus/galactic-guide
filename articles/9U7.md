<p>Petite Cola is the trademark cola of all Veritech pilots! Its super-caffeinated, hyper-sugary flavor is enough to send any kid flying off the wall!</p>
<p>Petite Cola is sold in bottles, cans, and barrels. You can find its vending machines all over the world, more specifically, Macross Island. If you can't find it, it will find you - this is because of the robotic vending machines that know when to make a deal.</p>
<p>Here is a dialog recorded by one of our prospecting vending machines, that demonstrates the appeal of Petite Cola:</p>
