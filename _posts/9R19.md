footnotes: {"[1]":"The \"limited amount\" of research was due to the fact that I spent half of the voyage trying to figure out how to pay for the flight, and the other half wishing I had been upgraded to First Class. Should any offers of free travel or free upgrades be forthcoming, I will probably be able to give a much more \"detailed\" [2] analysis.","[2]":"For the cynical of mind, replace \"detailed\" with \"biased\".","[3]":"\"Prettiest\" is, of course, a rather subjective term, but this was my personal conclusion, given the limited amount of research I was able to perform [4].","[4]":"The \"limited amount\" of research was due to the fact that I was too busy trying to meet my slave-driver Editor's deadlines, and incidentally, too shy. Should any offers of the chance to perform a more in-depth analysis on the Air France flight crew be forthcoming, I will be happy to re-evaluate my analysis.","[5]":"After tremendous criticism of a previous article, where I shortened the unwieldy \"he or she\" definite article [6] to \"he\", I am now writing all of my articles in Uni-sex mode [7].","[6]":"All right, maybe its not the definite article, but who really cares [8]?","[7]":"Sorry guys, that doesn't count for footnote 4.","[8]":"Sick of footnotes?

<p>Being an up-and-coming Field Researcher, I often find myself happily trotting around the globe with one airline or another. This might not quite qualify me as an airline critic, but it doesn't qualify me for much else either, so I'll give it a go anyway.</p>
<p>The limited amount of research <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>, I was able to perform has revealed the following:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Air France has the best food;</li>
<li value="2">Air France has the best red wine;</li>
<li value="3">Air France has the second prettiest hostesses <a href="#footnotes.3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a>; and</li>
<li value="4">Air France has the most strikes.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, each traveler must make its <a href="#footnotes.5" class="footnote-link">[5]</a> own decision as to whether the above counts as a good reason to make a conscious choice of Air Carrier next time they fly. For me, I'm going to flag down that pretty Hostess, and ask for some more red wine.</p>
