footnotes: {"[1]":"I don't want to be sexist/speciest, but I can't be bothered typing in \"he/she/its\" every time. It doesn't scan very well either, and often comes out sounding like \"He shits\", which is not particularly poetic. So, I am just going to use \"he\" from now on. Sorry.","[2]":"\"Go\" is the traditional, albeit unimaginative, choice.","[3]":"Or more commonly, staggers.","[4]":"This should be 10 cans, but don't depend on it. Rottomathematics often apply, which is even more tortuous than Bistromathematics."}

<pre>
Requirements: - Warm weather, or someone who doesn't mind the inside
                of their house being destroyed.
              - A table and six chairs, in the vicinity of the first
                requirement.
              - One "Master of Ceremonies."
              - Six players, preferably already a little drunk.
              - Each player must provide six cans of beer.  All beer
                cans should be the same sort/brand.
              - As many spectators as possible, also all preferably drunk
</pre>
<pre>
Procedure:   - Each player should remove his/her/its <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a> T-shirt,
               and tie it in a vague headband fashion around their
               forehead.
             - Each player then places one can on the table.  The MC
               selects one can, and shakes it thoroughly.  It can also
               be passed around the spectators for some "audience
               involvement"
             - The players sit down, with their foreheads on the table.
               the MC places the shaken can down with the others, and
               mixes them thoroughly.
             - On pronunciation of the appropriate signal <a href="#footnotes.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a>, the
               players grab for a can, quickly hold it to their ear,
               and open the ring-pull.
             - One player will receive a spray of frothy beer in the
               ear, and he must then drink/wear the rest of the can
               as quickly as possible.  The other players then finish
               their beers, ready for the next round.
             - Play then continues, with one player less each round.
               The winner is the last "alive", and he then walks <a href="#footnotes.3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a>
               away with the rest of the beers <a href="#footnotes.4" class="footnote-link">[4]</a>.
