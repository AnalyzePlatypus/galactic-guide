<p>Weston Super Mare is a small town that seems to be fairly mobile. It started its life as a small fishing village in rural Somerset. Then someone brought the steam railway here, and it's been downhill from then on.</p>
<p>In the seventies it made its first move to the new county of Avon. Everyone hated this and so in the early nineties this was corrected by moving it to North Somerset. I hope we don't move again, since no one knows where we are now.</p>
<p>Weston Super Mare is infamous (locally anyway) for the lovely sandy beach, but since it is on the Bristol Channel, the sea is rarely seen. When the tide does arrive, it is an attractive chocolate colour. The inhabitants love the town so much that many travel 20 miles to Bristol to escape from it every day. (They say this is for work, but we know better.) Weston has two piers so you can walk out over the mud and marvel at the achievements of those industrious Victorians. There are also the obligatory donkeys, amusement arcades, gift shops, and numerous public houses.</p>
