<p>One way of winning an argument is repeating your point over and over again. Just repeat what you have to say, whatever they bring against it. Nothing matters more than to counter a counter argument with the same thing you've been saying all along. Just repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat it. You might say this will never convince anyone, but that is not important, just repeat your message. People will absolutely hear and understand what you say if you repeat it long enough. Repeating is enough to win any argument. All you need to do is to repeat the same words over and over again. If someone disagrees with you just say "Yes, but..." and tell them the same words again.... So we see, repetition is the key of winning any argument. Don't forget it.</p>
<p>Repetition.</p>
<p>Although this will never really convince people your argument is the best, they will get so bored and tired that they'll agree with anything, just as long as you SHUT UP!!!! <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
