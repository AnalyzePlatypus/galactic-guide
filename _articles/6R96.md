<p>Don't even try to.</p>
<p>[Editor's Note: This article was originally one word long, however I felt that a topic as important as this deserved quite a bit more detailed exploration so I increased the article text from "Don't" to "Don't even try it". I hear there are ugly rumours that we are trying to cut down on the length of the guide. I would like to quash those rumours right now.]</p>
