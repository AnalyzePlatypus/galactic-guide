<p>The Thirsty is the day which follows the WhensDay. The Whensday is the day when people say "when's this silly text ending?" So tomorrow is the thirsty, if you are not a camel. Camels don't get thirsty, because they can't read and so they won't be able to ask "when's this silly text ending," and thirsty can only come after whensday.</p>
<p>Boris Becker won't win any Wilbeldon on dueceday, so he becomes sadder and sadder (they call it sadderday). If he never wins, he must be week. <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
