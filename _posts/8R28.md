<p>Training professional pilots, regardless of whether those pilots will end up flying F-15s for the USAF or 747s for KLM, is extremely expensive. One way of controlling costs is the extensive use of full-motion virtual reality flight simulators <a href="#footnotes.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Virtual reality flight simulators have become very similar to reality in the visual domain, but have obvious limitations when it comes to simulating movement: if you integrate all the accelerations your simulated plane seems to be doing, you end up traveling the distance the plane would if it were actually flying <a href="#footnotes.2" class="footnote-link">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>The part of your inner ear that measures acceleration is only briefly stimulated by the start of a movement in the simulator; the rest is done visually, which works because the visual system, having acquired extensive real-world experience, is capable of generating the same sensations as real accelerations <a href="#footnotes.3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a>. Moreover, your neural system is capable of learning, and quickly at that: in a flight simulator, especially a military one where maneuvers are much more extreme than in a civilian simulator, the pilot learns within an hour to associate visual movement with only very little input from the inner ear.</p>
<p>When the pilot next happens to accelerate in the real world (and it reportedly has happened just quickly walking down the stairs after a simulator session) his system revolts <a href="#footnotes.4" class="footnote-link">[4]</a> because of the cognitive dissonance caused by conflicting actual input and experience. Not a good idea at Mach 0.8 and 50 meters above the tree tops. Fortunately, one un-learns (or, rather, re-learns) within a day or two.</p>
