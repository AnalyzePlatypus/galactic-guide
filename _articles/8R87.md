    text: "If you&apos;re feeling particularly confident, you might also look at words such as &quot;yesterday&quot;, where &quot;y&quot; begins and ends. If you are feeling creative, or have a better dictionary than I, you might even come up with a word that begins with, ends with, and has &quot;y&quot; in the middle."

<p>The twenty-fifth letter of the modern English alphabet. Popular in that it has become a simple contraction for the most famous question of all time, namely: "why?" Also popular because of its elegant appearance, and undoubted linguistic usefulness.</p>
<p>Its bounds extend from being the letter which begins words such as "yellow", "yack", and "yolk" (several of very few), to becoming the end of a great many words, such as "wintery", "sixty", and "aerodynamically". It is also used inside words such as "dynamic" to add a little elegance, where an "I" would otherwise fester <a href="#footnote-body.1" name="footnote-link.1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>It is also used, in its lower-case form, as a symbol to represent the second axis in a coordinate system, where "x" is the first, and "z" tends to be the third. In this form, it is usually used to mean "vertical". As a symbol, it can also represent the Japanese currency (the Yen).</p>
<p>Finally, the letter "Y" is represented by the communications code-word "Yankee" and, though perhaps for other reasons, is very popular in Wales.</p>
