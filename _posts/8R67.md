<p>This is not everything. Neither is it nothing. It is all that isn't. But it isn't that either. The truth is that as soon as something has been defined, it isn't part of "everything else". Everything else is the exclusion of all that has already been mapped. Oh, well, now it no longer exists. Look what you made me do! <!--Amazon_CLS_IM_END--></p>
