<p>Some people sometimes wonder what type of computer hardware and software would be most beneficial to have while in law school, and what other stuff students have found to be extremely helpful.</p>
<p>Well, I can tell you the study of law requires lots of equipment that you will have to go out and purchase, so here's my list:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">You'll certainly need a Cylindrical Graphite Trace Depositor, and I recommend getting a dozen or so with an Organic Cellulose Binding Tube. It should be Apogee-tipped with a Compressionable Appendage that makes Error Correction a snap.</li>
<li value="2">Any law student needs a Serial Cell Plate Collation, with Blue Linear Scoring in the Horizontal Mode. Highly portable and energy efficient, these come in bundles of 250 or 500 cells. These are usually Verso-linearly bound in steel, however, some "loose-leaf."</li>
<li value="3">My favorite law school tool is the Legume Hyperbaric Steam Injection Apparatus. I use it every morning; as a matter of fact, I couldn't get out of the house without its rich bounty of Caffeinated Amino Acid Compounds. Milk and sugar, please.</li>
</ol>
