<p>The following are details on the sports to be found at the Park Road Sports Centre, in alphabetical order:</p>
<p>AQUAFIT</p>
<p>Water-based keep-fit classes for a hour on a Monday from 7.00pm and 8.00pm for #1.40.</p>
<p>AQUANATAL</p>
<p>A hour-long session of movement and music in the small pool from 10.00am on a Monday for mothers and babies (#1.85 or for leisure pass holders 75p).</p>
<p>GYMNASTICS</p>
<p>The Park Road sports centre is the city's premier location for gymnastic training, churning out gold medal winners like a sausage machine. Its sports hall is entirely devoted to this cause. So many young hopefuls have been trying to attend the gymnastics classes that the hall has had to be enlarged by 67 percent. The training sessions with the coaches themselves are quite cheap (#1.40 youngsters, #2.20 adults), but have to be arranged by appointment. There are organized sessions for beginners (under 8s) on Saturday mornings, and for "over the hills" on Wednesdays (7.30-9.00pm ).</p>
<p>GYMTOTS</p>
<p>This is a basic introduction to movement and dance in a fun environment for under 5s costing #1.85. It takes place on a Monday (10.00-11.00am) (11.00-12.00pm) (12.00-1.00pm) (1.00-2.00pm) and on a Friday (11.00-12.00pm) (12.00-1.00pm) (1.00-2.00pm).</p>
<p>HEALTH SUITE</p>
<p>Over 18s can use the centre's sauna, sun beds (for 30 minutes), steam and spa baths (which are all incorporated within the lounge area) for #1.20, if you're a non-leisure pass holder, and for free if you hold on or you're an O.A.P.</p>
<p>KEEP-FIT</p>
<p>Land-based aerobics (with female dance instructor) for an hour, costing #1.40. Available on a Tuesday (7.00pm-8.00pm), Thursday (7.30pm-8.30pm) and Sunday (3.00pm-4.00pm).</p>
